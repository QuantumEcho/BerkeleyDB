<h1 align=center>Building the Test Suite: FAQ</h1>
<ol>
<p><li>
<b>Berkeley DB was configured using --enable-test, but it fails to build.</b>
<p>
Unfortunately, there is no single location in which to find the Tcl
include file (<tcl.h>) or the Tcl library (libtcl.a) on different platforms.
DB configuration does not do anything special to locate the Tcl
include file, and adds "-ltcl -lm" to attempt to find the Tcl
library.
If your Tcl include file is not in one of the standard places checked
by your compiler,
then you will have to add ADDCPPFLAGS and/or ADDLIBS and ADDLDFLAGS to
your environment and reconfigure.
For example:
<p><ul><pre>
% env ADDCPPFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ../dist/configure --enable-test
</pre></ul><p>
See <a href="../build/unix.html">Building for UNIX platforms</a>
for more information.
<p>
You may also need to add additional libraries in order to get the Tcl test
suite to load.  Linux systems often require linking "libtcl.a" to
"libtcl#.#.a" or adding "-ldl" to the load line.  Solaris systems often
require adding "-lsocket" and sometimes "-lnsl -ldl" to the load line.
These changes are most simply done by editing the Makefile in your build
directory explicitly.
<p>
Alternatively, you can download Tcl from the
<a href="http://www.scriptics.com">Scriptics Corporation</a> web site.
build it locally, and simply add "-I../../tcl.7.4" to the CFLAGS line,
and "-L../../tcl.7.4" to the load line for the dbtest program,
in your build directory's Makefile.
(Note, if you download a different version than 7.4, use the version
number from the one you downloaded!)

<b>Berkeley DB was built using --enable-test, but I get an error message
about "TCL_LIBRARY" when I run dbtest.</b>
<p>
If the Tcl library with which you loaded was not located in the
"/usr/local/lib" directory, you will need to set the "TCL_LIBRARY"
environment variable to the library directory below the path where
it was found, e.g., "../../tcl.7.4/library".

<b>Berkeley DB was built using --enable-test, but it fails to pass the
test suite.</b>
<p>
Check to make sure that TESTDIR is not on a NFS mounted filesystem.  The
Berkeley DB architecture does not support placing the shared memory regions on
remote filesystems, e.g., the Network File System (NFS) and the Andrew
File System (AFS).  For this reason, the shared memory regions (normally
located in a database home directory) must reside on a local filesystem.
