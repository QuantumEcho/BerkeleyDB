<b>My Win* C/C++ application crashes in the Berkeley DB library when Berkeley DB calls
fprintf (or some other standard C library function).</b>
<p>
You should be using the "Debug Multithreaded DLL" compiler option in your
application when you link with the build_win32/Debug/libdb.lib library
(this .lib file is actually a stub for libdb.DLL).  To check this setting
in Visual C++, choose the "Project/Settings" menu item, and under the tab
marked "C/C++", select "Code Generation" and see the box marked "Use
runtime library".  This should be set to "Debug Multithreaded DLL".  If
your application is linked against the static library,
build_win32/Debug/libdbs.lib, then you will want to set "Use runtime
library" to "Debug Multithreaded".
<p>
Setting this option incorrectly can cause multiple versions of the
standard libraries to be linked into your application (one on behalf
of your application, and one on behalf of the Berkeley DB library).  That
violates assumptions made by these libraries, and traps can result.
