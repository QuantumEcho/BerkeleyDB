<h1 align=center>Building a Shared Library Version of Berkeley DB</h1>
<p>
If you are on Windows/NT or Windows, you can build a shared library version
of Berkeley DB by opening the build_win32/Berkeley_DB.dsw workspace and
selecting target DB_DLL.  Set the configuration to Win32 Debug, and build.
Make sure there is a build_win32/Debug/libdb.dll as a result.
<p>
If you are using a UNIX platform, you will need to do a little extra work
to build a shared library version of Berkeley DB DB.  By default, Berkeley DB builds
as a static library.  If you've already built Berkeley DB, you can copy your
build directory to use as a work space, e.g.:
<p><ul><pre>
% cd db-VERSION
% cp -r build_unix build_shlib
% cd build_shlib
% make clean
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
Now you'll need to consult your system documentation to understand how to
build Berkeley DB as a shared library.  As UNIX architectures do not all build
shared libraries the same way, Berkeley DB is not distributed with support for
building shared libraries.
<p>
Examples for building shared library versions of Berkeley DB are available
for <a href="../build/shared_hp.html">HP/UX</a> and
<a href="../build/shared_gcc.html">the generic GCC compiler</a>.
If you build a shared library version of Berkeley DB for a compiler and
architecture combination for which we do not have an example, please
email the procedure to us, and we'll add it to the collection.
