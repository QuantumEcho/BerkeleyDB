<h3>Building Berkeley DB on a UNIX platform:</h3></a>

<p>
To perform the default build of Berkeley DB, first change to the
<b>build_unix</b> directory, and then enter the following two commands:
<p><pre>
	../dist/configure
	make
</pre>

This will build the Berkeley DB library.
To install the Berkeley DB library, enter:
<p><pre>
	make install
</pre>

<p>
See below for specific information on what files are installed and in what
directories, and how to configure installation on a per-system basis.

<p>
If you want to rebuild DB, enter:
<p><pre>
	make clean
	make
</pre>

<p>
If you change your mind about how Berkeley DB is configured, you must start
from scratch by entering:
<p><pre>
	make distclean
	../dist/configure
	make
</pre>

<p>
To build multiple UNIX versions of Berkeley DB in the same source tree, create a
new directory at the same level as build_unix, and then configure and build.
<p><pre>
	mkdir build_bsdos3.0
	cd build_bsdos3.0
	../dist/configure
	make
</pre>

<p>
Java support cannot be built using the configuration options.  To configure
and build the Java API, see the file db/java/README for more information.

<p>
If you have trouble with any of these commands, please send email to the
addresses found in the Sleepycat Software contact information.  In that
email, please provide a complete copy of the commands that you entered and
their output.

<a name="configure">
<h3>Berkeley DB's configuration options:</h3></a>
<p>
There are many options that you can enter to the configuration program,
only a few of which are Berkeley DB specific.  To see a complete list of the
options, enter <b>../dist/configure --help</b>.

<p>
The Berkeley DB specific options are as follows:

<p>
<b>--enable-cxx</b>:
<ul>
If you want to include C++ interfaces in the library, enter <b>--enable-cxx</b>
as an argument to configure.
</ul>

<p>
<b>--enable-debug</b>:
<ul>
If you want to build Berkeley DB with <b>-g</b> as a compiler flag and with
<b>DEBUG</b> #defined during compilation, enter <b>--enable-debug</b> as an
argument to configure.
This will create Berkeley DB with debugging symbols, as well as load various
routines that can be called from a debugger to display pages, cursor queues
and so forth.
This flag should probably not be defined when configuring to build production
binaries, although there shouldn't be any significant performance degradation.
</ul>

<p>
<b>--enable-diagnostic</b>:
<ul>
If you want to build Berkeley DB with debugging run-time sanity checks and
with DIAGNOSTIC #defined during compilation, enter <b>--enable-diagnostic</b>
as an argument to configure.  This will cause a number of special checks
to be performed when Berkeley DB is running.  This flag should NOT be
defined when configuring to build production binaries, as you will lose
a significant amount of performance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>--enable-compat185</b>:
<ul>
If you want to compile or load Berkeley DB 1.85 applications against the
DB 2.0 library, enter <b>--enable-compat185</b> as an argument to configure.
This will include Berkeley DB 1.85 API compatibility code in the library.
</ul>

<p>
<b>--enable-dump185</b>:
<ul>
If you need to convert Berkeley DB 1.85 (or earlier) databases to Berkeley
DB 2.0 databases, enter <b>--enable-dump185</b> as an argument to
configure.
This will build the
<a href="../utility/db_dump.html">dump_185</a> utility.
This utility will dump Berkeley DB 1.85 and 1.86 databases in a format
readable by the
<a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility.
For more information, see
<a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> and
<a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a>.
<p>
The system libraries with which you are loading the
<a href="../utility/db_dump.html">dump_185</a>
utility MUST already contain the Berkeley DB 1.85 library routines for this
to work, as the Berkeley DB distribution does not include them.  If you
are using a non-standard library for the Berkeley DB 1.85 library routines,
you will have to change the Makefile that the configuration step creates to
load the <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">dump_185</a> utility
with that library.
</ul>

<p>
<b>--enable-test</b>:
<ul>
If you want to build the Tcl test suite, enter <b>--enable-test</b> as an
argument to configure.
<b>The Tcl test suite will only build if the Tcl libraries and include
files are already available on the system!</b>
</ul>

<p>
<b>--disable-bigfile</b>:
<ul>
Some systems, notably versions of AIX, HP/UX and Solaris, require special
compile-time options in order to create files larger than 2^32 bytes.
These options are automatically enabled when Berkeley DB is compiled.
For this reason, binaries built on current versions of these systems may
not run on earlier versions of the system, as the library and system calls
necessary for large files are not available.  To disable building with
these compile-time options, enter <b>--disable-bigfile</b> as an argument
to configure.
</ul>

<a name="change">
<h3>Changing compilers, libraries or compiler and loader options:</h3></a>
<p>
You can specify a compiler and/or compile and load time flags by using
environment variables during configuration.  For example, if you want
to use a specific compiler, specify the CC environment variable before
running configure:
<p>
<ul>
env CC=gcc ../dist/configure
</ul>

<p>
Using anything other than the native compiler will almost certainly
mean that you'll want to check the compile and load line flags, too.

<p>
To specify debugging and optimization options for the C compiler,
use the CFLAGS environment variable:
<p>
<ul>
env CFLAGS=-O2 ../dist/configure
</ul>

<p>
To specify header file search directories and other miscellaneous options
for the C preprocessor and compiler, use the CPPFLAGS environment variable:
<p>
<ul>
env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/contrib/include ../dist/configure
</ul>

<p>
To specify debugging and optimization options for the C++ compiler,
use the CXXFLAGS environment variable:
<p>
<ul>
env CXXFLAGS=-Woverloaded-virtual ../dist/configure
</ul>

<p>
To specify miscellaneous options for the linker, use the LDFLAGS
environment variable:
<p>
<ul>
env LDFLAGS="-N32" ../dist/configure
</ul>

<p>
If the Tcl or any other include files or libraries are in non-standard
places on your system, you will need to specify the directory path where
they can be found.

<p>
If you want to specify additional libraries and library directories, set
the LIBS environment variable before running configure.  For example:
<p>
<ul>
env LIBS="-L/a/b -L/e/f -lposix" ../dist/configure
</ul>
<p>
would specify two additional directories to search for libraries, /a/b
and /e/f, and one additional library to load, "posix".

<p>
Make sure that you prepend -L to any library directory names and that you
prepend -I to any include file directory names!  Also, make sure that you
quote the arguments as shown above, i.e. with single or double quotes
around the values you're specifying for LIBS, if they contain blank or
tab characters.

<p>
The env command is available on most systems, and simply sets one or more
environment variables before running a command.  If the env command is
not available to you, you can set the environment variables in your shell
before running configure.  For example, in sh or ksh, you could do:
<p>
<ul>
LIBS="-L/a/b -L/e/f -ldb" ../dist/configure
</ul>
<p>
and in csh or tcsh, you could do:
<p>
<ul>
setenv LIBS "-L/a/b -L/e/f -ldb"
../dist/configure
</ul>

<p>
See your shell's manual page for further information.

<a name="install">
<h3>Installing Berkeley DB:</h3></a>
<p>
Berkeley DB installs the following files into the following locations,
with the following default values:

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
	<th>Variables</th>
	<th>Default value</th>
</tr><tr>
	<td>prefix</td>
	<td>/usr/local</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>bindir</td>
	<td>$(prefix)/BerkeleyDB/bin</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>includedir</td>
	<td>$(prefix)/BerkeleyDB/include</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>libdir</td>
	<td>$(prefix)/BerkeleyDB/lib</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>mandir</td>
	<td>$(prefix)/BerkeleyDB/docs</td>
</tr><tr>
	<th>File(s)</th>
	<th>Default location</th>
</tr><tr>
	<td>db.h, db_cxx.h, db_185.h</td>
	<td>$(includedir)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>libdb.a</td>
	<td>$(libdir)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>utilities</td>
	<td>$(bindir)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>documentation</td>
	<td>$(mandir)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
To move the entire installation tree to somewhere besides
<b>/usr/local</b>, change the value of <b>prefix</b>.  To move the
binaries to a different place, change the value of <b>bindir</b>.  The
values of <b>includedir</b>, <b>libdir</b> and <b>mandir</b> may be
similarly changed.  These values can be changed as part of configuration:

<p>
<ul>
../dist/configure --prefix=/usr/contrib
</ul>
<p>
or when doing the install itself:
<p>
<ul>
make prefix=/usr/contrib install
</ul>

<p>
Note, the installation process will attempt to create any directories that
do not already exist on the system.
