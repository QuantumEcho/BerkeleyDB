<h1 align=center>Building for Windows platforms</h1>
<p>
The build_win32 directory contains project files for both MSVC4.X and 5.0:
<p>
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><td>DB_VC4.mdp</td><td>Visual C++ 4.0 project file</td></tr>
<tr><td>DB_VC4.mak</td><td>Makefile exported by Visual C++ 4.0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Berkeley_DB.dsw</td><td>Visual C++ 5.0 project file</td></tr>
<tr><td>*.dsp</td><td>Visual C++ 5.0 subprojects</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In MSVC5.0, open the file <b>Berkeley_DB.dsw</b>  The 5.0 project files are
fully developed, allowing you to build both DLL and static versions of
libdb, the test harness and the command-line utilities.  To ensure that
correct versions of include files are used, select the menu item Tools/Options
under tab Directories, Platform Win32 and select Include files.  Put the
build_win32 subdirectory on the list followed by the include subdirectory,
and select OK.
If you want to build absolutely everything,
select the <b>db_buildall</b> subproject and build.
<p>
When building your application, you should normally use compile options
"debug multithreaded dll" and link against <b>build_win32/Debug/libdb.lib</b>.
If you want to link against a static (non-DLL) version of the library,
use the "debug multithreaded" compile options and link against
<b>build_win32/Debug/libdbs.lib</b>.
<p>
In MSVC4.X, first move your distribution directory to \db (so that the
project file is \db\build_win32\DB_VC4.mdp for some drive letter).
Then open the file <b>DB_VC4.mdp</b>.  The 4.X project files currently
allow you to build only the DLL version of libdb.  To ensure that
correct versions of include files are used, select the menu item Tools/Options
under tab Directories, Platform Win32 and select Include files.  Put the
/db/build_win32 directory on the list followed by the /db/include directory,
and select OK.
<p>
C++ support is built automatically on Win32.
<p>
Java support is not built automatically.
