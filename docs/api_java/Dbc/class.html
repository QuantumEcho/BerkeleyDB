<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
This manual page describes the specific details of the Dbc class,
which provides cursor support for the access methods in <a href="../../api_java/Db/class.html">Db</a>.
<p>
The Dbc functions are the library interface supporting sequential
access to the records stored by the access methods of the Berkeley DB library.
Cursors are created by calling the <a href="../../api_java/Db/cursor.html">Db.cursor</a> method which returns a
 Dbc object.
<p>
Each cursor maintains positioning information within a set of key/data pairs.
In the presence of transactions, cursors are only valid within the
context of a single transaction, the one specified during the
<a href="../../api_java/Db/cursor.html">Db.cursor</a> call.
All cursor operations will be executed in the context of that transaction.
Before aborting or committing a transaction, all cursors used within that
transaction must be closed.
In the presence of transactions, the application must call <a href="../../api_java/DbTxn/abort.html">DbTxn.abort</a>
if any of the cursor operations returns that a deadlock (EAGAIN) or system
failure occurred.
<p>
When locking is enabled, page locks are retained between consecutive cursor
calls.
For this reason, in the presence of locking, applications should discard
cursors as soon as they are done with them.
Calling the <a href="../../api_java/Db/close.html">Db.close</a> method discards any cursors opened in the context
of a particular <a href="../../api_java/Db/class.html">Db</a> object returned by the <a href="../../api_java/Db/open.html">Db.open</a> call.
