<h1 align=center>Logical record numbers</h1>
<p>
The Berkeley DB B+tree, Queue and Recno <a href="intro.html">access methods</a> can
operate on logical record numbers.
In all cases for the Queue and Recno access methods, and in some cases
with the B+tree access method, a record number is specified to reference
a specific key/data pair.  In the case of B+tree supporting duplicate data
items, the logical record number refers to a key and all of its data
items.
<p>
Record numbers are 32-bit unsigned types, which limits the number of
logical records in a database to 4,294,967,296.  The first record in the
database is record number 1.
<p>
Record numbers in Recno databases can be configured to run in either
mutable or fixed mode: mutable, where logical record numbers change as
records are deleted or inserted, and fixed, where record numbers never
change regardless of the database operation.  (See
<a href="../../ref/am_conf/renumber.html">Logically renumbering records
(DB_RENUMBER)</a> for more information.
<p>
Record numbers in B+tree databases are always mutable, and as records are
deleted or inserted, the logical record number for other records in the
database can change.
<p>
Record numbers in Queue databases are always fixed, and never change
regardless of the database operation.
<p>
Configuring B+tree databases to support record numbers can severely limit
the throughput of applications with multiple concurrent threads writing
the database, because locations used to store record counts often become
hot spots that many different threads all need to update.
