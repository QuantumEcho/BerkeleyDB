<h1 align=center>What does the Berkeley DB distribution include?</h1>
<p>
The Berkeley DB distribution includes complete source code for the Berkeley DB library
and its supporting utilities, as well as complete documentation.  The
distribution does not include pre-built binaries or libraries (pre-built
libraries and binaries for some architecture/compiler combinations are
available as part of Sleepycat Software's Berkeley DB support services).
