<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Introduction</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Where does Berkeley DB run?</h1>
<p>
Berkeley DB requires only underlying POSIX 1003.1 system calls and can be ported
easily to new architectures by adding stub routines to connect the native
system interfaces to the Berkeley DB POSIX-style system calls.
<p>
Berkeley DB will autoconfigure and run on almost any modern UNIX platform, and
even on most historical UNIX platforms.  See <a href="../../build/unix.html">Building for UNIX platforms</a> for more information.
<p>
In addition, the Berkeley DB distribution includes support for Windows/95 and
Windows/NT, via the MSVC 4 and 5 applications.  See
<a href="../../build/win32.html">Building for Windows platforms</a> for more
information.
<p>
Ports to Windows 3.1 and Digital Equipment Corp.'s VMS environment are
included in the Berkeley DB distribution, but are less well-tested at this time.
