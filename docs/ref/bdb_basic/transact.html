<h3 align=center>Using transactions</h3>
<p><a href="../transapp/intro.html">Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store
applications</a> have standard transactional characteristics: recoverability,
atomicity and integrity.  The Java API provides these transactional capabilities
using a <i>transaction-per-thread</i> model.  Once a transaction is begun,
it is implicitly associated with the current thread until it is committed or
aborted.  This model is used for the following reasons.</p>
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>The transaction-per-thread model is commonly used in other Java APIs
such as J2EE.
<li>Since the Java collections API is used for data access, there is no
way to pass a transaction object on each call to methods such as
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#put">Map.put</a>
.
</ul>
<p>The Java API provides two transaction APIs.  The lower-level API is the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/CurrentTransaction.html">CurrentTransaction</a>
 class.  It provides a way
to get the transaction for the current thread, and to begin, commit and abort
transactions.  It also provides access to the Berkeley DB core API
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/db/DbTxn.html">DbTxn</a>
 object.  With
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/CurrentTransaction.html">CurrentTransaction</a>
, just as in the core API,
the application is responsible for beginning, committing and aborting
transactions, and for handling deadlock exceptions and retrying operations.
This API may be needed for some applications, but it is not used in the
example.</p>
<p>The example uses the higher-level 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html">TransactionRunner</a>
 and 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionWorker.html">TransactionWorker</a>
APIs, which are build on top of 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/CurrentTransaction.html">CurrentTransaction</a>
.  
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html#run">TransactionRunner.run</a>
automatically begins a transaction and then calls the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionWorker.html#doWork">TransactionWorker.doWork</a>
 method, which is
implemented by the application.</p>
<p>The 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html#run">TransactionRunner.run</a>
 method
automatically detects deadlock exceptions and performs retries by repeatedly
calling the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionWorker.html#doWork">TransactionWorker.doWork</a>
 method
until the operation succeeds or the maximum retry count is reached.  If
the maximum retry count is reached or if another exception (other than
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/db/DbDeadlockException.html">DbDeadlockException</a>
) is thrown by
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionWorker.html#doWork">TransactionWorker.doWork</a>
, then the
transaction will be automatically aborted.  Otherwise, the transaction
will be automatically committed.</p>
<p>Using this high-level API, if 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html#run">TransactionRunner.run</a>
 throws an exception, the application can assume that
the operation failed and the transaction was aborted; otherwise, when an
exception is not thrown, the application can assume the operation succeeded and
the transaction was committed.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>The <b>Sample.run</b> method creates a
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html">TransactionRunner</a>
 object and calls its
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html#run">TransactionRunner.run</a>
 method.</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<b>import com.sleepycat.bdb.TransactionRunner;
import com.sleepycat.bdb.TransactionWorker;
</b>...
public class Sample
{
    private SampleDatabase db;
    ...
<b>    private void run()
        throws Exception
    {
        TransactionRunner runner = new TransactionRunner(db.getEnvironment());
        runner.run(new PopulateDatabase());
        runner.run(new PrintDatabase());
    }
<p>
    private class PopulateDatabase implements TransactionWorker
    {
        public void doWork()
            throws Exception
        {
        }
    }
<p>
    private class PrintDatabase implements TransactionWorker
    {
        public void doWork()
            throws Exception
        {
        }
    }
</b>}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The <b>run</b> method is called by <b>main</b> and was outlined in
the previous section.  It first creates a 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html">TransactionRunner</a>
, passing the database environment to its constructor.</p>
<p>It then calls 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html#run">TransactionRunner.run</a>
to execute two transactions, passing instances of the application-defined
<b>PopulateDatabase</b> and <b>PrintDatabase</b> inner classes.  These
classes implement the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionWorker.html#doWork">TransactionWorker.doWork</a>
 method and will be fully described in the next two sections.</p>
<p>For each call to 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html#run">TransactionRunner.run</a>
, a separate transaction will be performed.  The use of two transactions in
the example -- one for populating the database and another for printing its
contents -- is arbitrary.  A real-life application should be designed to create
transactions for each group of operations that should have recoverability,
atomicity and integrity, while also taking into account the impact of
transactions on performance.</p>
<p>The advantage of using 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionRunner.html">TransactionRunner</a>
 is that deadlock retries and transaction begin, commit and
abort are handled automatically.  However, a 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionWorker.html">TransactionWorker</a>
 class must be implemented for each type of transaction.  If
desired, anonymous inner classes can be used to implement the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/TransactionWorker.html">TransactionWorker</a>
 interface.</p>
