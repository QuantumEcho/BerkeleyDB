<h1 align=center>Recovery and filesystem operations</h1>
<p>
When running in a transaction-protected environment, database creation
and deletion are logged as stand-alone transactions internal to Berkeley DB.
That is, for each such operation a new transaction is begun and aborted
or committed internally, so that they will be recovered during recovery.
<p>
While the Berkeley DB API supports explicit removal of a file via the
<a href="../../api_c/db_remove.html">DB-&gt;remove</a> method, Berkeley DB does not support opening a file with
<a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_TRUNCATE">DB_TRUNCATE</a> in a transaction protected environment.  This is an
implicit file deletion, but one that does not always require the same
operating system file permissions as does deleting and creating a file.
Also, there is no support for renaming a database in the API, and so
there is no way to log such an activity and therefore, no way to recover
a filesystem rename operation.
<p>
If you have changed the name of a file or deleted it outside of the Berkeley DB
library (e.g., you explicitly removed a file using your normal operating
system utilities), then it is possible that recovery will not be able to
find a database referenced in the log.  In this case, <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a>
will produce a warning message saying it was unable to locate a file it
expected to find.  This message is only a warning, as the file may have
been subsequently deleted as part of normal database operations before
the failure occurred, and so is not necessarily a problem.
<p>
Generally, any filesystem operations that are performed outside the Berkeley DB
interface should be performed at the same time as making a snapshot of
the database.  To perform filesystem operations correctly:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>Cleanly shutdown database operations.
<p>
To shutdown database operations cleanly, all applications accessing the
database environment must be shutdown and a transaction checkpoint must
be taken.  If the applications are not implemented such that they can be
shutdown gracefully (i.e., closing all references to the database
environment), recovery must be performed after all applications have been
killed to ensure that the underlying databases are consistent on disk.
<p><li>Perform the filesystem operations, e.g., rename one or more files.
<p><li>Make an archival snapshot of the database.
<p><li>Restart the database applications.
</ol>
