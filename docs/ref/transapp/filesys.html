<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Transaction Protected Applications</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Recovery and filesystem operations</h1>
<p>
Filesystem operations, e.g., moving the database environment to a
different machine or file creation, deletion or renaming, cannot be
transaction protected.  For this reason, files cannot be re-created,
deleted or renamed as part of the recovery process.
<p>
If recovery cannot find a database file referenced in the log, it will
output a warning message that it was unable to locate a file it expected
to find.  This message is only a warning, as the file may have
subsequently been deleted as part of normal database operations before
the failure occurred, and so cannot be known to be a problem.
<p>
<b>Note that committed transactions that involved these missing files are
rolled forward, even though the files were not found.  If the files were
not intentionally deleted (e.g., they were created after the last database
snapshot, but were lost during a failure), they must be manually created
(using <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>), and then recovery must be redone.</b>
<p>
Generally, it is simplest to perform filesystem operations at the same
time as making a snapshot of the database.  To perform filesystem
operations:
<ol>
<p><li>Cleanly shutdown database operations.
<p><li>Rename, create or delete files.
<p><li>Make a snapshot of the database.
<p><li>Restart database applications.
</ol>
<p>
To cleanly shutdown database operations, all applications accessing the
database environment must be shutdown and a transaction checkpoint must
be taken.  If the applications are not
implemented such that they can be shutdown gracefully (i.e., closing all
references to the database environment), recovery must be performed after
all applications have been killed to ensure that the underlying databases
are consistent on disk.
<p>
<b>Future versions of Berkeley DB are expected to remove the restriction that
database files must be manually created before recovery is performed.</b>
