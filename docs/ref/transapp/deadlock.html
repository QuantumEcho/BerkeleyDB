<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Transaction Protected Applications</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Deadlock Detection</h1>
<p>
The first component of the infrastructure, <i>deadlock detection</i>,
is not so much a requirement specific to transaction protected
applications, but rather is necessary for almost all applications where
more than a single thread of control will be accessing the database at
one time.  (It is not required by <b>all</b> such applications, as
read-only applications cannot deadlock, however there are a <b>very</b> few
applications where the access pattern to the data is sufficiently well
structured that deadlock cannot occur.) Regardless, while Berkeley DB
automatically handles database locking issues, it is
normally possible for deadlock to occur.
<p>
When the deadlock actually occurs, what happens is that two (or more)
processes (or threads, i.e., any thread of control) that hold locks
request other locks that cannot be granted, and will never be granted
because one of the processes now waiting holds the resource in question.
<p>
For example, consider two processes A and B.  Let's say that A obtains an
exclusive lock on item X, and B obtains an exclusive lock on item Y.  Then,
A requests a lock on Y and B requests a lock on X.  A will wait until
resource Y becomes available and B will wait until resource X becomes
available.  Unfortunately, since both A and B are waiting, neither will
release the locks they hold and neither will ever obtain the resource on
which it is waiting.  In order to detect that deadlock has happened, a
separate process or thread must review the locks currently held in the
database.  If deadlock has occurred, a victim must be selected, and that
victim will then return the error EAGAIN from the database call it was
making.
<p>
Berkeley DB provides a separate UNIX-style utility which can be used to perform
this deadlock detection, named, cleverly enough, <a href="../../utility/db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock</a>.
Alternatively, applications can create their own deadlock utility or
thread using the underlying <a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/detect.html">lock_detect</a> function, or specify that
Berkeley DB run the deadlock detector internally whenever there is a conflict
over a lock (see lk_detect for more information).
<p>
Deciding how often to run the deadlock detector and which of the
deadlocked transactions will be forced to abort when the deadlock is
detected is a common tuning parameter for Berkeley DB applications.
