<h3 align=center>Degrees of isolation</h3>
<a name="2"><!--meow--></a>
<p>Transactions can be isolated from each other to different degrees.
<i>Repeatable reads</i> provide the most isolation, and mean that,
for the life of the transaction, every time a thread of control reads
a data item, it will be unchanged from its previous value (assuming, of
course, the thread of control does not itself modify the item).  Berkeley DB
enforces repeatable reads whenever database reads are wrapped in
transactions.  This is also known as <i>degree 3 isolation</i>.</p>
<p>Most applications do not need to enclose reads in transactions, and when
possible, transactionally protected reads should be avoided as they can
cause performance problems.  For example, a transactionally protected
cursor sequentially reading each key/data pair in a database, will
acquire a read lock on most of the pages in the database and so will
gradually block all write operations on the databases until the
transaction commits or aborts.  Note, however, that if there are update
transactions present in the application, the read operations must still
use locking, and must be prepared to repeat any operation (possibly
closing and reopening a cursor) that fails with a return value of
<a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.  Applications that need repeatable reads are
ones that require the ability to repeatedly access a data item knowing
that it will not have changed (for example, an operation modifying a
data item based on its existing value).</p>

<p>A transaction may only require <i>cursor stability</i>, that is only
be guaranteed that cursors see committed data that does not change so
long as it is addressed by the cursor, but may change before the reading
transaction completes.  This is also called <i>degree 2
isolation</i>.  Berkeley DB provides this level of isolation when a transaction
is started with the <a href="../../api_c/db_cursor.html#DB_READ_COMMITTED">DB_READ_COMMITTED</a> flag.  This flag may also
be specified when opening a cursor within a fully isolated
transaction.</p>

<p>Berkeley DB optionally supports reading uncommitted data; that is, read
operations may request data which has been modified but not yet
committed by another transaction.  This is also called <i>degree
1 isolation</i>.  This is done by first specifying the
<a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> flag when opening the underlying database,
and then specifying the <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> flag when beginning
a transaction, opening a cursor, or performing a read operation.  The
advantage of using <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</a> is that read operations
will not block when another transaction holds a write lock on the
requested data; the disadvantage is that read operations may return data
that will disappear should the transaction holding the write lock
abort.</p>
