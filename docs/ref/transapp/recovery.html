<h1 align=center>Recovery procedures</h1>
<p>
The fourth component of the infrastructure, recovery procedures,
concerns the recoverability of the database.  After any application or
system failure, there are two possible approaches to database recovery.
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>There is no need for recoverability, and all databases can be recreated
from scratch, therefore the database home directory can simply be removed
and recreated.
<p><li>It is necessary to recover information after system or application failure.
Recovery (using the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility, or the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a>
or <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> flags to <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>) must be performed
on each Berkeley DB application environment, that is, each database home directory.
</ol>
<p>
Performing recovery will remove all the shared regions (which may have
been corrupted by the failure), establish the end of the log by
identifying the last record written to the log, and then perform
transaction recovery.  Database applications must not be restarted until
recovery completes.  During recovery, all changes made by aborted or
unfinished transactions are undone and all changes made by committed
transactions are redone, as necessary.  After recovery runs, the
environment is properly initialized so that applications may be restarted.
Any time an application crashes or the system fails, recovery processing
should be performed on any database environments that were active at that
time.
<p>
Additionally, there are two forms of recovery: 
<ol>
<p><li><i>catastrophic</i> recovery.  The Berkeley DB package defines catastrophic
failure to be failure where either the database or log files have been
destroyed or corrupted.  For example, catastrophic failure includes the
case where the disk drive on which either the database or logs are stored
has been physically destroyed, or when the system's normal filesystem
recovery on startup is unable to bring the database and log files to a
consistent state.
<p>
If the failure is catastrophic, a snapshot of the database files and the
archived log files must be restored onto the system.  Then the recovery
process will review the logs and database files to bring the database to
a consistent state as of the time of the last archived log file.  Only
transactions committed before that date will appear in the database.
<p><li><i>normal</i> or <i>non-catastrophic</i> recovery.  If the failure
is non-catastrophic, i.e., the database files and log are accessible on
a filesystem that has recovered cleanly, the recovery process will review
the logs and database files to ensure that all committed transactions
appear and that all uncommitted transactions are undone.
</ol>
<h3>Recovery process</h3>
<p>
The recovery process works as follows:
<p>
First, find the last checkpoint that completed.  Since the system may
have crashed while writing a checkpoint, this implies finding the
second-to-last checkpoint in the log files.  Read forward from this
checkpoint, opening any database files for which modifications are found
in the log.
<p>
Then, read backward from the end of the log.  For each commit record
encountered, record its transaction ID.  For every other data update
record, find the transaction ID of the record.  If that transaction ID
appears in the list of committed transactions, do nothing; if it does not
appear in the committed list, then call the appropriate recovery routine
to undo the operation.
<p>
In the case of catastrophic recovery, this roll-backward pass continues
through all the present log files.  In the case of normal recovery, this
pass continues until we find a checkpoint written before the second-to-last
checkpoint described above.
<p>
When the roll-backward pass is complete, the roll-forward pass begins at
the point where the roll-backward pass ended.  Each record is read and if
its transaction id is in the committed list, then the appropriate recovery
routine is called to redo the operation if necessary.
<p>
In a distributed transaction environment, there may be transactions that
are prepared, but not yet committed.  If these transactions are XA
transactions, then they are rolled forward to their current state, and an
active transaction corresponding to it is entered in the transaction table
so that the XA transaction manager may call either transaction abort or
commit, depending on the outcome of the overall transaction.  If the
transaction is not an XA transaction, then it is aborted like any other
transactions would be.
