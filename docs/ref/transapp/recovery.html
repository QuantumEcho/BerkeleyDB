<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Transaction Protected Applications</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Recovery procedures</h1>
<p>
The fourth component of the infrastructure, <i>recovery procedures</i>,
concerns the recoverability of the database.  After any application or
system failure, there are two possible approaches to database recovery.
<p>
If there is no need to retain state across the failure, and all databases
can be recreated from scratch, the database home directory can simply be
removed and recreated.
<p>
If it is necessary to retain persistent state across failures, then
recovery (using the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility, or the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a>
or <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> flags to <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>) must be
performed on each Berkeley DB application environment, that is, each database
home directory.
<p>
Performing recovery will remove all the shared regions (which may have
been corrupted by the failure), establish the end of the log by
identifying the last record written to the log, and then perform
transaction recovery.  Database applications must not be restarted until
recovery completes.  During recovery, all changes made by aborted or
unfinished transactions are undone and all changes made by committed
transactions are redone, as necessary.  After recovery runs, the
environment is properly initialized so that applications may be restarted.
Any time an application crashes or the system fails, recovery processing
should be performed on any database environments that were active at that
time.
<p>
Additionally, there are two forms of recovery: <i>normal</i> recovery
and <i>catastrophic</i> recovery.  The Berkeley DB package defines
catastrophic failure to be failure where either the database or log files
have been destroyed or corrupted from the point of view of the filesystem.
For example, catastrophic failure includes the case where the disk drive
on which either the database or logs are stored has crashed, or when
filesystem recovery is unable to bring the database and log files to a
consistent state with respect to the filesystem.
<p>
If the failure is non-catastrophic, i.e., the database files and log are
accessible on a filesystem that has recovered cleanly, the recovery
process will review the logs and database files to ensure that all
committed transactions appear and that all uncommitted transactions are
undone.
<p>
If the failure is catastrophic, a snapshot of the database files and the
archived log files must be restored onto the system.  Then the recovery
process will review the logs and database files to bring the database to
a consistent state as of the date of the last archived log file.  Only
transactions committed before that date will appear in the database.
