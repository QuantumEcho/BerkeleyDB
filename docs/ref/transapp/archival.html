<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Transaction Protected Applications</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Archival procedures</h1>
<p>
The third component of the infrastructure, <i>archival procedures</i>,
concerns the recoverability of the database and the disk consumption of
the database log files.
<p>
There are two separate aspects to these issues.  First, you may want to
periodically create snapshots (i.e., backups) of your databases to make
it possible to recover them from catastrophic failure.  Second, you'll
want to periodically remove log files in order to conserve disk space.
The two procedures are distinct from each other, and you cannot remove
the current log files simply because you have created a database snapshot.
<p>
<h1>Archival for recovery:</h1>
<p>
To create a snapshot of your database that can be used to recover from
catastrophic failure, the following steps should be taken:
<ol>
<p><li>Run <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> <b>-s</b> to identify all of the database data
files that must be saved, and copy them to a backup device, (e.g., tape).
If the database files are stored in a separate directory from the other
Berkeley DB files, it may be simpler to archive the directory itself instead
of the individual files.
<p>
<b>More importantly, if any of the database files have not been
accessed during the lifetime of the current log files, <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a>
will not list them in its output!</b> For this reason, it may be important
to use a separate database file directory, archiving it instead of the
files listed by <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a>.
<p><li>If your database is currently active, i.e., you are reading and writing
to the database files while the snapshot is being taken, run
<a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> <b>-l</b> to identify the database log files that
you must save, and
copy them to a backup device, (e.g., tape).  If the database log files
are stored in a separate directory from the other database files, it may
be simpler to archive the directory itself instead of the individual
files.
</ol>
<p>
Note that the order of these operations is important, and that the
database files <b>must</b> be archived before the log files.
<p>
The Berkeley DB library supports on-line backups, and it is not necessary to
stop reading or writing your databases during the time when you create
this snapshot.  It is important to note, however, that the snapshot of an
active database will be consistent as of some unspecified time between
the start of the archival and when archival is completed.
<p>
To create a snapshot as of a specific time, you must stop reading and
writing your databases for the entire time of the archival, force a
checkpoint (see <a href="../../utility/db_checkpoint.html">db_checkpoint</a>), and then archive the files listed
by the <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> utility's <b>-s</b> and <b>-l</b> options.
<p>
Once these steps are completed, your database can be recovered from
catastrophic failure to its state as of the time the archival was done.
To update your snapshot so that recovery from catastrophic failure is
possible up to a new point in time, repeat step #2, copying all existing
log files to a backup device.
<p>
Each time that a complete snapshot is made, i.e. all database and log
files are copied to backup media, you may discard all previous snapshots
and saved log files.
<p>
The time to restore from catastrophic failure is a function of the number
of log records that have been written since the snapshot was originally
created.  Perhaps more importantly, the more separate pieces of backup
media you use, the more likely that you will have a problem reading from
one of them.  For these reasons, it is often best to make snapshots on a
regular basis.
<p>
<b>For archival safety remember to ensure that you have multiple copies of
your database backups, that you verify that your archival media is
error-free, and that copies of your backups are stored off-site!</b>
<p>
To restore your database after catastrophic failure,
the following steps should be taken:
<ol>
<p><li>Restore the copies of the database files from the backup media.
<p><li>Restore the copies of the log files from the backup media, <b>in
the order in which they were written</b>.  (It's possible that the same log
file appears on multiple backups, and you only want the most recent
version of that log file!)
<p><li>Run <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> <b>-c</b> to recover the database.
</ol>
<p>
It is possible to recreate the database in a location different than the
original, by specifying appropriate pathnames to the <b>-h</b> option
of the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility.
<p>
<h1>Archival to conserve log file space:</h1>
<p>
To remove log files, the following steps should be taken:
<ol>
<p><li>If you are concerned with catastrophic failure, first copy them to backup
media (e.g., tape), as described above.  This is because log files are
necessary for recovery from catastrophic failure.
<p><li>Run <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> without options, to identify all of the log files
that are no longer in use (e.g., no longer involved in an active
transaction).
<p><li>Remove those log files from the system.
</ol>
