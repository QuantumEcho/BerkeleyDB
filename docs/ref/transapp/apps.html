<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Transaction Protected Applications</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Building transaction protected applications</h1>
<p>
Creating transaction protected applications using the Berkeley DB access methods
is quite easy.  In almost all cases, applications use <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>
to perform initialization of all of the Berkeley DB subsystems.  As transaction
support requires all five Berkeley DB subsystems, the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a>,
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>, <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOG">DB_INIT_LOG</a> and <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a> flags
should be specified.
<p>
Once the application has called <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>, it should open the
databases it will use.  Once the databases are opened, the application
can make changes to the databases, grouped inside of transaction calls.
Each set of changes should be surrounded by the appropriate
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/begin.html">txn_begin</a>, <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/commit.html">txn_commit</a> and <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/abort.html">txn_abort</a> calls.
<p>
The Berkeley DB access methods will make the appropriate calls into the lock,
log and memory pool subsystems in order to guarantee transaction semantics.
When the application is ready to exit, all outstanding transactions should have
been committed or aborted.
<p>
Databases accessed by a transaction must not be closed during the
transaction.  Once all outstanding transactions are finished, all open
Berkeley DB files should be closed.  When the Berkeley DB database files have been
closed, the environment should be closed by calling <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appexit.html">db_appexit</a>.
<p>
It is not necessary to transaction protect read-only transactions, unless
those transactions require repeatable reads.  However, if there are update
transactions present in the database, the reading transactions must still
use locking, and should be prepared to repeat any operation (possibly
closing and reopening a cursor) which fails with a return value of EAGAIN.
<p>
Consider an application suite where multiple processes (or, multiple
threads of control in a single process, for that matter) are changing the
values associated with a key in one or more databases.  Specifically, they
are taking the current value, incrementing it, and then storing it back
into the database.  There are two reasons that such an application needs
transactions (other than the obvious requirement of recoverability after
application or system failure):
<p>
The first additional reason for transactions is that the application needs
atomicity, i.e., since we want to change a value that's currently in the
database, we have to make sure that once we read it, no other thread of
control modifies it.  For example, let's say that both thread #1 and
thread #2 are doing similar operations in the database, where thread #1
is incrementing records by 3, and thread #2 is incrementing records by 5.
What we want to happen is to increment the record by a total of 8.  If
the operations interleave in the right (well, wrong) order, that is not
what will happen:
<p>
<p><ul><pre>
thread #1  <b>read</b> record: the value is 2
thread #2  <b>read</b> record: the value is 2
thread #2  <b>write</b> record + 5 back into the database (new value 7)
thread #1  <b>write</b> record + 3 back into the database (new value 5)
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
As you can see, instead of incrementing the record by a total of 8, we've
only incremented it by 3, because thread #1 overwrote thread #2's
change.  By wrapping the operations in transactions, we ensure that this
cannot happen.  In a transaction, when the first thread reads the record,
locks are acquired that will not be released until the transaction
finishes, guaranteeing that all other readers and writers will block,
waiting for the first thread's transaction to complete (or to be aborted).
<p>
The second additional reason is that when multiple processes or threads
of control are modifying the database, there is the potential for
deadlock.  In Berkeley DB, deadlock is signified by an error return from the
Berkeley DB function of EAGAIN.
<p>
Here is an example function that does transaction protected increments
on database records:
<p>
<p><ul><pre>
int
increment(dbenv, dbp, key, increment)
	DB_ENV *dbenv;
	DB *dbp;
	DBT *key;
	int increment;
{
	DBT data;
	DB_TXN *tid;
	DB_TXNMGR *txnp;
	char buf[64];
<p>
	/* Initialization. */
	txnp = dbenv->tx_info;
	memset(&data, 0, sizeof(data));
<p>
	/* Abort and retry the modification. */
	if (0) {
retry:		if (txn_abort(tid) != 0)
			err("txn_abort");
		/* FALLTHROUGH */
	}
<p>
	/* Begin the transaction. */
	if ((errno = txn_begin(txnp, NULL, &tid)) != 0)
		err("txn_begin");
<p>
	/* Get the key. */
	switch (errno = dbp->get(dbp, tid, key, &data, 0)) {
	case EAGAIN:
		goto retry;
	case 0:
		break;
	case DB_NOTFOUND:
		if (txn_commit(tid))
			err("txn_commit");
		return (0);
	}
<p>
	/* Get the current value, add the increment. */
	(void)sprintf(buf, "%d", atoi(data.data) + increment);
	data.data = buf;
	data.size = strlen(buf) + 1;
<p>
	/* Store the new value. */
	switch (errno = dbp->put(dbp, tid, key, &data, 0)) {
	case EAGAIN:
		goto retry;
	case 0:
		break;
	default:
		(void)txn_abort(tid);
		err("dbp->put");
	}
<p>
	/* The transaction finished, commit it. */
	if ((errno = txn_commit(tid)) != 0)
		err("txn_commit");
<p>
	return (0);
}
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
In applications supporting transactions, note that all Berkeley DB functions
have an additional possible error return: EAGAIN.  In the above sample
code, you can see that any time the Berkeley DB function returns EAGAIN, the
transaction is aborted (<a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/abort.html">txn_abort</a>, which releases all of its
resources), and then the transaction is retried, from scratch.  There is
no requirement that the transaction be attempted again, but that is the
common thing for applications to do.
<p>
There is one additional error that transaction protected applications
need to handle, and which is not shown in the above example.
<p>
There exists a class of errors that Berkeley DB considers fatal to an entire
Berkeley DB environment.  An example of this type of error is a log write
failure due to the disk being out of free space. The only way to recover
from these failures is for the application to exit, run recovery of the
Berkeley DB environment, and re-enter Berkeley DB. (It is not strictly necessary that
the application exit, although that is the only way to recover system
resources, e.g., file descriptors and memory, currently allocated by
Berkeley DB.)
<p>
When this type of error is encountered, the error value
DB_RUNRECOVERY is returned. This error can be returned by any
Berkeley DB interface. If a fatal error occurs, DB_RUNRECOVERY will be
returned from all subsequent Berkeley DB calls made by any threads or processes
participating in the environment.
<p>
Optionally, applications may also specify a fatal-error callback function
by setting the db_paniccall field of the DB_ENV structure before
initializing the environment with <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>.  This callback
function will be called with two arguments: a reference to the DB_ENV
structure associated with the environment, and the <b>errno</b> value
associated with the underlying error that caused the problem.
<p>
Applications can handle such fatal errors in one of two ways: by checking
for DB_RUNRECOVERY as part of their normal Berkeley DB error return
checking, similarly to EAGAIN in the above example, or, in applications
that have no cleanup processing of their own, by simply exiting the
application when the callback function is called.
