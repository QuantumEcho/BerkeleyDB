<h1 align=center>Building transaction protected applications</h1>
<p>
Creating transaction-protected applications using the Berkeley DB access methods
is quite easy.  In almost all cases, applications use <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>
to perform initialization of all of the Berkeley DB subsystems.  As transaction
support requires all five Berkeley DB subsystems, the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a>,
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>, <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_LOG">DB_INIT_LOG</a> and <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a> flags
should be specified.
<p>
Once the application has called <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>, it should open the
databases it will use.  Once the databases are opened, the application
can make changes to the databases inside of transactions.  Each set of
changes that entail a unit of work should be surrounded by the appropriate
<a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html">txn_begin</a>, <a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">txn_commit</a> and <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">txn_abort</a> calls.
<p>
The Berkeley DB access methods will make the appropriate calls into the lock,
log and memory pool subsystems in order to guarantee transaction semantics.
When the application is ready to exit, all outstanding transactions should have
been committed or aborted.
<p>
Databases accessed by a transaction must not be closed during the
transaction.  Once all outstanding transactions are finished, all open
Berkeley DB files should be closed.  When the Berkeley DB database files have been
closed, the environment should be closed by calling <a href="../../api_c/env_close.html">DBENV-&gt;close</a>.
<p>
It is not necessary to transaction-protect read-only operations, unless
those transactions require repeatable reads.  However, if there are update
transactions present in the application, the reading transactions must
still use locking, and should be prepared to repeat any operation
(possibly closing and reopening a cursor) which fails with a return value
of <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.
<p>
Consider an application suite where multiple threads of control (multiple
processes or threads in one or more processes) are changing the values
associated with a key in one or more databases.  Specifically, they are
taking the current value, incrementing it, and then storing it back into
the database.  There are two reasons that such an application needs
transactions (other than the obvious requirement of recoverability after
application or system failure):
<p>
The first reason for transactions is that the application needs atomicity.
Since we want to change a value in the database, we must make sure that
once we read it, no other thread of control modifies it.  For example,
assume that both thread #1 and thread #2 are doing similar operations in
the database, where thread #1 is incrementing records by 3, and thread #2
is incrementing records by 5.  We want to increment the record by a total
of 8.  If the operations interleave in the right (well, wrong) order, that
is not what will happen:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>thread #1  <b>read</b> record: the value is 2
thread #2  <b>read</b> record: the value is 2
thread #2  <b>write</b> record + 5 back into the database (new value 7)
thread #1  <b>write</b> record + 3 back into the database (new value 5)</pre></blockquote>
<p>
As you can see, instead of incrementing the record by a total of 8, we've
only incremented it by 3, because thread #1 overwrote thread #2's
change.  By wrapping the operations in transactions, we ensure that this
cannot happen.  In a transaction, when the first thread reads the record,
locks are acquired that will not be released until the transaction
finishes, guaranteeing that all other readers and writers will block,
waiting for the first thread's transaction to complete (or to be aborted).
<p>
The second reason for transactions is that when multiple processes or
threads of control are modifying the database, there is the potential for
deadlock.  In Berkeley DB, deadlock is signified by an error return from the
Berkeley DB function of <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.
<p>
Here is an example function that does transaction-protected increments on
database records.
<p>
<blockquote><pre>void
increment(dbenv, dbp, key, increment)
	DB_ENV *dbenv;
	DB *dbp;
	DBT *key;
	int increment;
{
	DBT data;
	DB_TXN *tid;
	int ret;
	char buf[64];
<p>
	/* Initialization. */
	memset(&data, 0, sizeof(data));
<p>
	/* Abort and retry the modification. */
	if (0) {
retry:		if ((ret = txn_abort(tid)) != 0)
			db_err(dbenv, ret, "txn_abort");
		/* FALLTHROUGH */
	}
<p>
	/* Begin the transaction. */
	if ((ret = txn_begin(dbenv, NULL, &tid)) != 0)
		db_err(dbenv, ret, "txn_begin");
<p>
	/* Get the key. */
	switch (ret = dbp-&gt;get(dbp, tid, key, &data, 0)) {
	case DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK:
		goto retry;
	case 0:
		break;
	case DB_NOTFOUND:
		if (txn_commit(tid))
			db_err(dbenv, ret, "txn_commit");
		return (0);
	}
<p>
	/* Get the current value, add the increment. */
	(void)sprintf(buf, "%d", atoi(data.data) + increment);
	data.data = buf;
	data.size = strlen(buf) + 1;
<p>
	/* Store the new value. */
	switch (ret = dbp-&gt;put(dbp, tid, key, &data, 0)) {
	case DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK:
		goto retry;
	case 0:
		break;
	default:
		(void)txn_abort(tid);
		db_err(dbenv, ret, "dbp-&gt;put");
	}
<p>
	/* The transaction finished, commit it. */
	if ((ret = txn_commit(tid)) != 0)
		db_err(dbenv, ret, "txn_commit");
<p>
	return (0);
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In applications supporting transactions, all Berkeley DB functions have an
additional possible error return: <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.  In the sample
code, any time the Berkeley DB function returns DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK, the
transaction is aborted (by calling <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">txn_abort</a>, which releases all
of its resources), and then the transaction is retried from the beginning.
There is no requirement that the transaction be attempted again, but that
is the common course of action for an application.
<p>
There is one additional error that transaction-protected applications need
to handle, and which is not shown in the above example.
There exists a class of errors that Berkeley DB considers fatal to an entire
Berkeley DB environment.  An example of this type of error is a log write
failure due to the disk being out of free space. The only way to recover
from these failures is for the application to exit, run recovery of the
Berkeley DB environment, and re-enter Berkeley DB. It is not strictly necessary that
the application exit, but that is the only way to recover system resources
such as file descriptors and memory.
<p>
When this type of error is encountered, the error value
<a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> is returned. This error can be returned by any
Berkeley DB interface. If a fatal error occurs, <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> will be
returned from all subsequent Berkeley DB calls made by any threads or processes
participating in the environment.
<p>
Optionally, applications may also specify a fatal-error callback function
using the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_paniccall.html">DBENV-&gt;set_paniccall</a> function.  This callback function will be
called with two arguments: a reference to the DB_ENV structure associated
with the environment, and the <b>errno</b> value associated with the
underlying error that caused the problem.
<p>
Applications can handle such fatal errors in one of two ways: by checking
for <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_RUNRECOVERY">DB_RUNRECOVERY</a> as part of their normal Berkeley DB error return
checking, similarly to <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a> in the above example, or,
in applications that have no cleanup processing of their own, by simply
exiting the application when the callback function is called.
