<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Transaction Subsystem</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Transactions and non-Berkeley DB applications</h1>
<p>
It is possible to use the locking, logging and transaction subsystems
of Berkeley DB to provide transaction semantics to objects other than those
described by the Berkeley DB access methods.  In these cases, the application
will need more explicit customization of the subsystems as well as the
development of appropriate data-structure-specific recovery functions.
<p>
For example, consider an application that provides transaction semantics
to data stored in plain UNIX files accessed using the read(2) write(2)
system calls.  The operations for which transaction protection is desired
are bracketed by calls to <a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/begin.html">txn_begin</a> and <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/commit.html">txn_commit</a>.
<p>
Before data are referenced, the application must make a call to the lock
manager, <a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/open.html">lock_open</a>, for a lock of the appropriate type (e.g.,
read) on the object being locked.  The object might be a page in the file,
a byte, a range of bytes, or some key.  It is up to the application to
ensure that appropriate locks are acquired.  Before a write is performed,
the application should acquire a write lock on the object, by making an
appropriate call to the lock manager, <a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/open.html">lock_open</a>.  Then, the
application should make a call to the log manager, <a href="../../api_c/DbLog/open.html">log_open</a>, to
record enough information to redo the operation in case of failure after
commit and to undo the operation in case of abort.  As discussed in the
<a href="../../api_c/DbLog/open.html">log_open</a> manual page, the application is responsible for providing
any necessary structure to the log record.  For example, the application
must understand what part of the log record is an operation code, what
part identifies the file being modified, what part is redo information,
and what part is undo information.
<p>
After the log message is written, the application may issue the write
system call.  After all requests are issued, the application may call
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/commit.html">txn_commit</a>.  When <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/commit.html">txn_commit</a> returns, the caller is
guaranteed that all necessary log writes have been written to disk.
<p>
At any time, the application may call <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/abort.html">txn_abort</a>, which will result
in the appropriate calls to the <b>recover</b> function to restore the
<i>database</i> to a consistent pre-transaction state.  (The recover
function must be able to either re-apply or undo the update depending on
the context, for each different type of log record.)
<p>
If the application should crash, the recovery process uses the
<a href="../../api_c/DbLog/open.html">log_open</a> interface to read the log and call the <b>recover</b>
function to restore the database to a consistent state.
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/prepare.html">txn_prepare</a> function provides the core functionality to
implement distributed transactions, but it does not manage the
notification of distributed transaction managers.  The caller is
responsible for issuing <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/prepare.html">txn_prepare</a> calls to all sites
participating in the transaction.  If all responses are positive, the
caller can issue a <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/commit.html">txn_commit</a>.  If any of the responses are
negative, the caller should issue a <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/abort.html">txn_abort</a>.  In general, the
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/prepare.html">txn_prepare</a> call requires that the transaction log be flushed to
disk.
