<h1 align=center>Windows Notes</h1>
<p>
Various Berkeley DB interfaces take a <b>mode</b> argument, intended to specify
the underlying file permissions for created files.  Berkeley DB currently ignores
this argument on Windows systems.
<p>
It would be possible to construct a set of security attributes to pass to
<b>CreateFile</b> that accurately represents the mode.  In the worst
case, this would involve looking up user and all group names and creating
an entry for each.  Alternatively, we could call the <b>_chmod</b>
(partial emulation) function after file creation, although this leaves us
with an obvious race.
<p>
Practically speaking, however, these efforts would be largely meaningless
on FAT, the most common file system, which only has a "readable" and
"writeable" flag, applying to all users.
<dl compact>
<p><dt>Windows/95 note:<dd>On Windows/95, files that are opened by multiple processes do not share
data correctly.  For this reason, the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_SYSTEM_MEM">DB_SYSTEM_MEM</a> flag is implied
for any application that does not specify the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag.
<p><dt>Windows/NT note:<dd>On Windows/NT, each process has its own namespace within the system paging
file, and so processes cannot use it to share information.  (We are aware
that this is not as specified in the Windows/NT documentation.  However,
we have not been able to get multiple processes to share information in
the system paging file.  If you know how to do so, please let us know!)
For this reason, the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_SYSTEM_MEM">DB_SYSTEM_MEM</a> flag is ignored for Windows/NT
applications.
