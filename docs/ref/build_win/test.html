<h1 align=center>Running the test suite under Windows</h1>
<p>
These notes are for building the test suite on Win32 platforms.  Most of
the issues with the test suite on Win* are due to the operating systems
dependencies in the test suite itself, expressed as file names, process
management or CR/NL issues.
<p>
The test suite was originally developed and maintained on UNIX platforms,
so these dependencies crop up on every release as new tests are added or
modified for changes to Berkeley DB.  That much said, every release we work hard
to fix or work around issues that cause failures on Win/NT, but we are
not yet finished with Win/95.
<p>
Please read through all the instructions before you begin to ensure that
you have everything you need.
<p>
First, you need a set of UNIX-like utilities to assist Tcl with various
operations.  Currently we require: cmp, cp, kill, mkdir, mv, rm, sed,
sleep, sort and tr.  We have tested using the MKS/NT package, which mostly
works.  (If you use this package, see MKS/NT notes below).  The GNU
utilities should work as well, but you may discover different issues.  We
assume that these tools are in <b>c:/tools</b>, but this can be changed
by editing the <b>include.tcl</b> file.  Note that a "PERL5" variable
is referenced by the <b>include.tcl</b> file.  It is not necessary to
run the test suite, and may be left unset.
<p>
Second, you will need to get the Tcl toolkit.  The test suite requires at
least Tcl 8.1, and that is what we currently test with on our Win*
platforms.  These notes assume Tcl is installed as <b>d:/tcl</b>, but
you can change this if you wish.  We have found that we needed to rebuild
a debug version of Tcl from the sources to get correct behavior.  This is
because the set of DLLs linked into the Tcl executable must match the
corresponding set of DLLs used by Berkeley DB.
<p>
You will also need sufficient main memory and disk.  Disk is not terribly
demanding, something less than 100 MB should be sufficient.  For memory,
the more the better -- 32MB is too small, but 64MB should be fine.
<h3>Building the software needed by the tests</h3>
<p>
To build, perform the following steps.  Note that steps #1, #4 and #5 are
part of the normal build process for building Berkeley DB.
<ol>
<p><li>Open the <b>build_win32/Berkeley_DB.dsw</b> workspace.
<p><li>Add the pathname for the Tcl include subdirectory to your
include path.  To do this, under the "Tools" menu item, select "Options".
In the dialog, select the "Directories" tab, and choose directories
for "Include Files".  Add <b>d:/tcl/include</b> (or whatever directory
contains <b>tcl.h</b> in your distribution) to the list.
<p><li>Add the pathname for the Tcl library subdirectory to your
library path.  To do this, under the "Tools" menu item, select "Options".
In the dialog, select the "Directories" tab, and choose directories for
"Library Files".  Add <b>d:/tcl/lib</b> (or whatever directory contains
<b>tcl80.lib</b> in your distribution) to the list.
<p><li>Set the active configuration to build_all -- Debug.  To set an
active configuration, under the "Build" menu item in the IDE, select "Set
Active Configuration".  Then choose "build_all -- Debug".
<p><li>Build.  This will build the base Berkeley DB .dll and various tools
that are needed by the test suite.
<p><li>Set the active configuration to db_tcl -- Debug.  To set an
active configuration, under the "Build" menu item in the IDE, select "Set
Active Configuration".  Then choose "db_tcl -- Debug".
<p><li>Build.  That should create a
<b>build_win32/Debug/libdb_tclNNd.dll</b> file, where NN is the
major/minor numbers of the current release, for example NN would be "30"
for the Berkeley DB 3.0.1 release.
<p><li>Copy all the <b>build_win32/Debug/*.exe</b> files to the
build_win32 directory.  The test suite expects that programs such as
<b>db_archive.exe</b> will be found in this directory.
</ol>
<h3>Running the test suite under Windows</h3>
<p>
Before running the tests for the first time, you must edit the file
<b>include.tcl</b> in your build directory and change the line
that reads:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>set tclsh_path SET_YOUR_TCLSH_PATH</pre></blockquote>
<p>
You will want to use the location of the <b>tclsh</b> program.  For
example, if Tcl is installed as <b>d:/tcl</b>, this line should be:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>set tclsh_path d:/tcl/bin/tclsh81d.exe</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In addition you may need to change the path names of your UNIX-like
utilities.  These path names are set as lines like:
<blockquote><pre>set CP c:/tools/cp.exe</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Then, in a shell of your choice enter the following commands:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>cd build_win32
<p><li>run <b>d:/tcl/bin/tclsh80.exe</b>, or the equivalent name of
the Tcl shell for your distribution.
<p>
You should get a "%" prompt.
<p><li>% source ../test/test.tcl.
<p>
You should get a "%" prompt with no errors.
</ol>
<p>
You are now ready to run tests in the test suite.
<h3>Test suite failures</h3>
<p>
We will not release Berkeley DB with a FAIL message on Windows/NT, unless we
are sure it is a problem with the test suite, and not the Berkeley DB code.
However, there may still be error messages or warnings from various tests.
<p>
Known places where the tests typically give error messages:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>..../TESTDIR: expected 0, got memp_unlink: Error 0</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Often this kind of error occurs when one test has the database or
environment open at the time an unlink is done.  Removing a file is
always legal in UNIX, but on Win*, a file cannot generally be removed
if a process has it open.  We are slowly chasing these problems down.
<h3>MKS/NT notes</h3>
<p>
If you are using MKS/NT, you will find that there are a few tests that do
not work out of the box, because there are some tests that produce
input/output data that has long lines (more than 2048 characters).  These
lines are longer than the MKS default limit.  The "sort"
command breaks on these long lines.
<p>
The "sort" problem can be fixed by changing the maximum record length on
the command line.  To do this, add a "-z16384" option to the sort command.
You can change the .tcl script or hack up a replacement for sort.exe that
calls the real sort.exe with the extra options.  Unfortunately changing
include.tcl to have the extra option does not work.
<p>
The test suite also needs its own "kill" program that accepts the same
options as the UNIX kill.  We provide the source for a simple kill
program in <b>build_win32/killfix.cpp</b>.  This should be compiled
and installed as <b>c:/tools/kill.exe</b>.
