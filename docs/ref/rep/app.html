<h3 align=center>Building replicated applications</h3>
<p>The simplest way to build a replicated Berkeley DB application is to first
build (and debug!) the transactional version of the same application.
Then, add a thin replication layer to the application.  All highly available
applications use the following additional four Berkeley DB methods:
<a href="../../api_c/rep_elect.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect</a>, <a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_process_message</a>, <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> and
<a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_transport</a> and may also use the configuration method
<a href="../../api_c/rep_limit.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_limit</a>:</p>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_transport</a><dd>The <a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_transport</a> method configures the replication system's
communications infrastructure.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a><dd>The <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> method configures (or reconfigures) an existing database
environment to be a replication master or client.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_process_message</a><dd>The <a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_process_message</a> method is used to process incoming messages from other
environments in the replication group.  For clients, it is responsible
for accepting log records and updating the local databases based on
messages from the master.  For both the master and the clients, it is
responsible for handling administrative functions (for example, the
protocol for dealing with lost messages), and permitting new clients to
join an active replication group.  This method should only be called
after the environment has been configured as a replication master or
client via <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a>.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/rep_elect.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect</a><dd>The <a href="../../api_c/rep_elect.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect</a> method causes the replication group to elect a new
master; it is called whenever contact with the master is lost and the
application wants the remaining sites to select a new master.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/rep_limit.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_limit</a><dd>The <a href="../../api_c/rep_limit.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_limit</a> method imposes an upper bound on the amount of data
that will be sent in response to a single call to <a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_process_message</a>.
During client recovery, that is, when a replica site is trying to
synchronize with the master, clients may ask the master for a large
number of log records.  If it is going to harm an application for the
master message loop to remain busy for an extended period transmitting
records to the replica, then the application will want to use <a href="../../api_c/rep_limit.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_limit</a>
to limit the amount of data the master will send before relinquishing
control and accepting other messages.
</dl>
<p>To add replication to a Berkeley DB application, application initialization
must be changed and the application's communications infrastructure must
be written.  The application initialization changes are relatively
simple, but the communications infrastructure code can be complex.</p>
<p>During application initialization, the application performs three
additional tasks: first, it must specify the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_REP">DB_INIT_REP</a> flag
when opening its database environment; second, it must provide Berkeley DB
information about its communications infrastructure; and third, it must
start the Berkeley DB replication system.  Generally, a replicated application
will do normal Berkeley DB recovery and configuration, exactly like any other
transactional application.  Then, once the database environment has been
opened, it will call the <a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_transport</a> method to configure Berkeley DB for
replication, and then will call the <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> method to join or create
the replication group.</p>
<p>When calling <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> at application startup,
the application has two choices:
specifically configure the master for the replication group, or,
alternatively, configure all group members as clients and then call an
election, letting the clients select the master from among themselves.
Either is correct, and the choice is entirely up to the application.
The result of calling <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> is usually the discovery of a
master, or the declaration of the local environment as the master.  If
a master has not been discovered after a reasonable amount of time, the
application should call <a href="../../api_c/rep_elect.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_elect</a> to call for an election.</p>
<p>In the case of multiple processes or threads accessing a replicated
environment, any environment handle that modifies databases in the
environment or processes replication messages must call the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a> method.  Note that not all processes running in replicated
environments need to call <a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_transport</a> or <a href="../../api_c/rep_start.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_start</a>.
Read-only processes running in a master environment do not need to be
configured for replication in any way.  Processes running in a client
environment are read-only by definition, and so do not need to be
configured for replication either (although, in the case of clients that
may become masters, it is usually simplest to configure for replication
on process startup rather than trying to reconfigure when the client
becomes a master).  Obviously, at least one thread of control on each
client must be configured for replication as messages must be passed
between the master and the client.</p>
<p>For implementation reasons, all incoming replication messages must be
processed using the same <a href="../../api_c/env_class.html">DB_ENV</a> handle.  It is not required that
a single thread of control process all messages, only that all threads
of control processing messages use the same handle.</p>
<p>No additional calls are required to shut down a database environment
participating in a replication group.  The application should shut down
the environment in the usual manner, by calling the <a href="../../api_c/env_close.html">DB_ENV-&gt;close</a> method.</p>
