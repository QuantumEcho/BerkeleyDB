<h3 align=center>Synchronizing with a master</h3>
<p>When a client detects a new replication group master, the client must
synchronize with the new master before the client can process new
database changes.  Synchronizing is a heavyweight operation which can
place a burden on both the client and the master.  There are several
controls an application can use to reduce the synchronization burden.</p>
<h3>Delaying client synchronization</h3>
<p>When a replication group has a new master, either as specified by the
application or as a result of winning an election, all clients in the
replication group must synchronize with the new master.  This can strain
the resources of the new master since a large number of clients may be
attempting to communicate with and transfer records from the master.
Client applications wanting to delay client synchronization should call
the  <a href="../../api_c/rep_set_config.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_config</a> method with the <a href="../../api_c/rep_set_config.html#DB_REP_CONF_DELAYCLIENT">DB_REP_CONF_DELAYCLIENT</a>
flag.  This configuration causes the client to return
<a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html#DB_REP_NEWMASTER">DB_REP_NEWMASTER</a> from the <a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_process_message</a> method as always, but
the client will not proceed to synchronize with the new master.</p>
<p>Client applications choosing to delay synchronization in this manner are
responsible for synchronizing the client environment at some future time
using the <a href="../../api_c/rep_sync.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_sync</a> method.</p>
<h3>Client-to-client synchronization</h3>
<p>Clients may accept and service requests from other clients.  Clients
request records calling the client application's transport callback
function.  Requests that can be satisfied by other clients will have the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html#DB_REP_ANYWHERE">DB_REP_ANYWHERE</a> flag set for the transport function.
Applications may choose to send these requests to any client or to
ignore the flag and send them to the site specified by the message's
environment id.</p>
<p>Client applications may use whatever algorithm they choose to load
balance requests to other clients.  Any client receiving a request it
is unable to satisfy will reply to the requesting client, telling the
requesting client that it is unable to provide the requested
information, and the original client will re-request the information.
Additionally, if the original request never reaches the client to which
the application sends the request, the original client will again
re-request the information.  In either of these cases, the re-request
will have the <a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html#DB_REP_REREQUEST">DB_REP_REREQUEST</a> flag set for the transport
function.  Applications may respond to the <a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html#DB_REP_REREQUEST">DB_REP_REREQUEST</a>
flag by forwarding the request to the master (as specified by the
message's environment id), or by continuing to forward the request
to another client.</p>
<p>The delayed synchronization and client-to-client synchronization
features allow applications to do load balancing within replication
groups.  For example, consider a replication group with 5 sites, A, B,
C, D and E.  Site E just crashed, and site A was elected master.  Sites
C and D have been configured for delayed synchronization.  When site B
is notified that site A is a new master, it immediately synchronizes.
When B finishes synchronizing with the master, the application calls the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_sync.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_sync</a> method on sites C and D to cause them to synchronize as well.
Sites C and D (and E, when it has finished rebooting) can send their
requests to site B, and B then bears the brunt of the work and
network traffic for synchronization, making master site A available to
handle the normal application load and any write requests paused by
the election.</p>
<h3>Blocked client operations</h3>
<p>Clients in the process of synchronizing with the master block access to
Berkeley DB operations.  By default, most Berkeley DB methods will block until
client synchronization is complete, and then the method call proceeds.</p>
<p>Client applications which cannot wait and would prefer an immediate
error return instead of blocking, should call the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_set_config.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_config</a> method with the <a href="../../api_c/rep_set_config.html#DB_REP_CONF_NOWAIT">DB_REP_CONF_NOWAIT</a> flag.  This
configuration causes <a href="../../api_c/db_class.html">DB</a> method calls to immediately return a
<a href="../../api_c/db_put.html#DB_REP_LOCKOUT">DB_REP_LOCKOUT</a> error instead of blocking, if the client is
currently synchronizing with the master.</p>
<h3>Clients too far out-of-date to synchronize</h3>
<p>Clients attempting to synchronize with the master may discover that
synchronization is not possible because the client and master have been
out of contact for too long.  By default, the master and client
automatically detect this state and perform an internal initialization
of the client.  Because internal initialization requires transfer of
entire databases to the client, it can take a relatively long period of
time and may require database handles to be reopened in the client
applications.</p>
<p>Client applications which cannot wait and would prefer to postpone
internal initialization until a more convenient time, or would prefer
to do a hot backup instead of performing internal initialization, should
call the <a href="../../api_c/rep_set_config.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_config</a> method with the <a href="../../api_c/rep_set_config.html#DB_REP_CONF_NOAUTOINIT">DB_REP_CONF_NOAUTOINIT</a>
flag.  This configuration flag causes Berkeley DB to return
<a href="../../api_c/rep_message.html#DB_REP_JOIN_FAILURE">DB_REP_JOIN_FAILURE</a> to the application instead of performing
internal initialization.</p>
<p>Client applications choosing to delay synchronization in this manner are
responsible for synchronizing the client with the master at some future
time.  This can be accomplished by turning off the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_set_config.html#DB_REP_CONF_NOAUTOINIT">DB_REP_CONF_NOAUTOINIT</a> flag and calling the <a href="../../api_c/rep_sync.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_sync</a> method,
or by performing a hot backup.</p>
