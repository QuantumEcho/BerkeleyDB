<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Memory Pool Subsystem</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Berkeley DB and the memory pool</h1>
<p>
The memory pool subsystem is the general-purpose shared memory buffer pool
used by Berkeley DB.  This module is useful outside of the Berkeley DB package for
processes that require page-oriented, cached, shared file access.
<p>
A memory pool is a shared memory cache shared by any number of processes
and threads within processes.  The <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a> interface opens, and
optionally creates, a memory pool.  When that pool is no longer in use,
it should be closed, using the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/close.html">memp_close</a> interface.
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/DbMpoolFile/open.html">memp_fopen</a> interface opens an underlying file within the
memory pool.  When that file is no longer in use, it should be closed,
using the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpoolFile/close.html">memp_fclose</a> interface.  The <a href="../../api_c/DbMpoolFile/get.html">memp_fget</a> interface
is used to retrieve pages from files in the pool.  All retrieved pages
must be subsequently returned using the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpoolFile/put.html">memp_fput</a> interface.  At
the time that pages are returned, they may be marked <b>dirty</b>, which
causes them to be written to the backing disk file before being discarded
from the pool.  If there is insufficient room to bring a new page in the
pool, a page is selected to be discarded from the pool.  If that page is
dirty, it is first written to the backing file.  The page is selected
using a somewhat modified least-recently-used algorithm.  Pages in files
may also be explicitly marked clean or dirty using the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpoolFile/set.html">memp_fset</a>
interface.  All dirty pages in the pool from any underlying file may also
be flushed as a group using the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpoolFile/sync.html">memp_fsync</a> interface.
<p>
There are additional interfaces for manipulating the entire memory pool:
<p>
It is possible to gradually flush buffers from the pool in order to
maintain a consistent percentage of clean buffers in the pool using the
<a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/trickle.html">memp_trickle</a> interface.
<p>
The <a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility uses the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/stat.html">memp_stat</a> interface to
display statistics about the efficiency of the pool.
<p>
As some conversion may be necessary when pages are read into, or written
from, the pool, the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/db_register.html">memp_register</a> function allows applications to
specify automatic input and output processing in these cases.
<p>
There is one additional interface that is intended for manipulating the
memory pool, but which is specific to database systems.  The
<a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/sync.html">memp_sync</a> interface flushes dirty pages from all files held in
the pool up to the current database log sequence number.
<p>
Finally, the entire pool may be discarded using the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/unlink.html">memp_unlink</a>
interface.
