<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Memory Pool Subsystem</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Configuring the memory pool</h1>
<p>
There are two parameters for configuring the memory pool.
<p>
The most important tuning parameter for almost all applications (including
Berkeley DB applications), is the size of the pool.  There are two ways to
specify the pool size.  First, by setting the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html#mp_size">mp_size</a> field in
the DB_ENV structure.  This specifies the pool size for all of the
applications sharing the Berkeley DB environment.  Second, by setting the
<a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#db_cachesize">db_cachesize</a> field in the DB_INFO structure.  The latter
only specifies a pool size for the specific database.  Note, it is
meaningless to set the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#db_cachesize">db_cachesize</a> field for a database opened
inside of a Berkeley DB environment, since the environment pool size will
override any pool size specified for a single database.  For information
on tuning the Berkeley DB cache size, see <a href="../../ref/am/cachesize.html">Selecting a cache size</a>.
<p>
The second memory pool configuration parameter is the maximum size of
backing files to map into the process address space instead of copying
pages through the local cache.
<p>
Note, only read-only database files can be mapped into process memory.
Because of the requirements of Berkeley DB's transactional implementation, log
records describing database changes must be written to disk before the
actual database changes.  As mapping read-write database files into
process memory would permit the underlying operating system to write
modified database changes at will, it is not supported.
<p>
Mapping files into the process address space can result in
better-than-usual performance, as available virtual memory is normally
much larger than the local cache, and page faults are faster than page
copying on many systems.  However, in the presence of limited virtual
memory it can cause resource starvation, and in the presence of large
databases, it can result in immense process sizes.
<p>
To specify that no files are to be mapped into the process address space,
specify the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_NOMMAP">DB_NOMMAP</a> flag to the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a> or
<a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a> interface.  To specify that any individual file should
not be mapped into the process address space, specify the
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_NOMMAP">DB_NOMMAP</a> flag to the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a> interface.  To limit the
maximum size of files mapped into the process address space, set the
<a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html#mp_mmapsize">mp_mmapsize</a> field in the DB_INFO structure.
