<h3 align=center>Opening foreign key indices</h3>
<p>This section builds on the prior section describing secondary key
indices to show how to open foreign key indices.  A <i>foreign key
index</i> is a secondary key index that also provides integrity constraints.  When
the primary key of a record in one store is embedded in the value of a record
in another store, integrity constraints ensure that the record in the first
store exists, i.e, that there are no "dangling pointers".  In this example the
Shipment's PartNumber and SupplierNumber fields will be used as foreign keys.</p>
<p>When a foreign key index is defined, an "on delete" parameter is
specified.  This parameter determines what action is taken by the Java API when
the record is deleted to which a foreign key refers.  For example, consider
what happens to a Shipment record when a Part or Supplier record that is
referred to by that Shipment is deleted.  There are three possibilities.</p>
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html#ON_DELETE_ABORT">ForeignKeyIndex.ON_DELETE_ABORT</a>
specifies that the transaction should be aborted by throwing an exception.  The
effect is that deleting a Part or Supplier that is referred to by one or more
Shipments will not be possible.  The Java API will automatically throw an
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/IntegrityConstraintException.html">IntegrityConstraintException</a>
, which will
cause the transaction to be aborted during exception processing.  This option
may only be specified when transactions are used.
<li>
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html#ON_DELETE_CLEAR">ForeignKeyIndex.ON_DELETE_CLEAR</a>
specifies that the Part or Supplier Number field in the Shipment record should
be cleared, or set to a null or empty value.  The effect is that the deleted
Part or Supplier will no longer be referenced by any Shipment record.  This
option applies when the foreign key field is optional, i.e, when the
applications allows it to be set to a null or empty value.  When using this
option, the application must implement the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/KeyExtractor.html#clearIndexKey">KeyExtractor.clearIndexKey</a>
 method
such that after it is called the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/KeyExtractor.html#extractIndexKey">KeyExtractor.extractIndexKey</a>
 method
will return null.
<li>
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html#ON_DELETE_CASCADE">ForeignKeyIndex.ON_DELETE_CASCADE</a>
 specifies that the Shipment record should be deleted also.
The effect is that deleting a Part or Supplier will delete all Shipments for
that Part or Supplier.    This option applies when the deleted record
is considered the "parent" or "owner" of the record containing the
foreign key, and is used in this example.  Since deleting the Shipment
record could cause other deletions if other records contain the foreign
key of the Shipment, and so on, the term "cascade" is used to describe
the effect.

<p>The <b>SampleDatabase</b> class is extended to open the

<p>Opening a foreign key index requires creating a
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/serial/SerialFormat.html">SerialFormat</a>
, a
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/KeyExtractor.html">KeyExtractor</a>
, a
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/db/Db.html">Db</a>
 and a 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html">ForeignKeyIndex</a>
.  In the example two 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html">ForeignKeyIndex</a>
 objects are created, <b>shipmentByPartIndex</b> and
<b>shipmentBySupplierIndex</b>.</p>
<p>If you compare these statements for opening foreign key indices to the
statements used in the previous section for opening a secondary index,
you'll notice that the only significant differences are the parameters of the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html">ForeignKeyIndex</a>
 constructor, as compared to
the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/DataIndex.html">DataIndex</a>
 constructor.  The first three
parameters are the same.  The last two 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html">ForeignKeyIndex</a>
 parameters are used for enforcing integrity constraints.  The
fourth parameter is the foreign store that contains the records to which the
foreign keys refer.  The fifth and last parameter is the "on delete" action.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>The application-defined <b>ShipmentByPartExtractor</b> and
<b>ShipmentBySupplierExtractor</b> classes are shown below.  They were used
above to create the <b>partExtractor</b> and <b>supplierExtractor</b>
objects.</p>
<blockquote><pre>

<p>The key extractor classes above are almost identical to the one defined
in the previous section for use with a secondary index.  The index key fields
are different, of course, but the interesting difference is that the index keys
are extracted from the key, not the value, of the Shipment record.  This
illustrates that an index key may be derived from the store record key, value,
or both.</p>
<p>Note that the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/serial/SerialSerialKeyExtractor.html#clearIndexKey">SerialSerialKeyExtractor.clearIndexKey</a>
 methods above always throw an
exception, just like in the key extractor class in the previous section.  This
is because 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html#ON_DELETE_CLEAR">ForeignKeyIndex.ON_DELETE_CLEAR</a>
was not used when creating the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html">ForeignKeyIndex</a>
 objects.  If it were used, these methods would need to set the
part number and supplier number to null in the Shipment key.  But record keys
cannot be changed!  And in fact, the Shipment key is not passed to the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/serial/SerialSerialKeyExtractor.html#clearIndexKey">SerialSerialKeyExtractor.clearIndexKey</a>
 method, only the Shipment value is passed.  Therefore, if a
foreign index key is derived from the store record key,
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html#ON_DELETE_CLEAR">ForeignKeyIndex.ON_DELETE_CLEAR</a>
 may not be
used.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>The following getter methods return the index objects for use by other
classes in the example program.  The index objects are used to create Java
collections for accessing records via their foreign keys.</p>
<blockquote><pre>
public class SampleDatabase
{
    ...
<b>    public final ForeignKeyIndex getShipmentByPartIndex()
    {
        return shipmentByPartIndex;
    }
<p>
    public final ForeignKeyIndex getShipmentBySupplierIndex()
    {
        return shipmentBySupplierIndex;
    }
</b>}
</pre></blockquote>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html">ForeignKeyIndex</a>
 objects, just like
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/DataIndex.html">DataIndex</a>
 objects, are closed automatically
when their associated 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/DataStore.html">DataStore</a>
 is closed.
There is no way to close an index explicitly without closing the store.</p>
