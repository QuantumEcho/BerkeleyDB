<h3 align=center>RAM-only configurations</h3>
<p>Berkeley DB supports RAM-only configurations, however, Berkeley DB does not
guarantee writes will never be attempted to disk.</p>
<p>You can configure RAM-only databases by not specifying a physical file
name to the <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> method.  Databases created in this way will never
be written to disk unless Berkeley DB runs out of cache space.  Running out
of cache space happens when the application attempts to create a new
database page and there is no spare room in the cache, nor is there a
clean page which can simply be evicted from the cache, and a dirty page
must be written from the cache to disk to make room to create the new
page.  When Berkeley DB runs out of cache space, it will attempt to create a
temporary backing file to make new room in the cache, which is not what
you want.</p>
<p>You can create RAM-only database environments (in which you can work
with both RAM-only and disk-backed databases) in two different types of
memory: in heap memory or in system shared memory.  To create the
database environment in heap memory, specify the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag
to the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> method.  Database environments created in heap
memory are only accessible to the threads of a single process, however.
To create the database environment in system shared memory, specify the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_SYSTEM_MEM">DB_SYSTEM_MEM</a> flag to the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> method.  Database
environments created in system memory are accessible to multiple
processes.  However, database environments created in system shared
memory do create a small (roughly 8 byte) file in the file system read
by the processes to identify the system shared memory segments to use.</p>
<p>Finally, if your database environment is intended to be transactionally
protected or recoverable after application or system failure (that is,
if you configure either the locking or transaction subsystems in the
database environment), both the databases and database environment log
files must be written to disk.  There is currently no way in the Berkeley DB
database environment to support transactions without writing log files
to disk.</p>
