<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Programmer Notes</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Database limits</h1>
<p>
The largest database file that Berkeley DB can handle depends on the page size
selected by the application.  Berkeley DB stores database file page numbers as
unsigned 32-bit numbers and database file page sizes as unsigned 16-bit
numbers.  Using the maximum database page size of 65536, this results in
a maximum database file size of 2<sup>48</sup> (256 petabytes).  The
minimum database page size is 512 bytes, which results in a minimum
maximum database size of 2<sup>41</sup> (2 terabytes).
<p>
The largest database file Berkeley DB can support is potentially further limited
if the host system does not have filesystem support for files larger than
2<sup>32</sup>, including the ability to seek to absolute offsets within
those files.
<p>
The largest key or data items that Berkeley DB can support is largely limited
by available memory.  Specifically, while key and data byte strings may
be of essentially unlimited length, any one of them must fit into
available memory so that it can be returned to the application.  As some
of the Berkeley DB interfaces return both key and data items to the application,
those interfaces will require that any key/data pair fit simultaneously
into memory.  Further, as the access methods may need to compare key and
data items with other key and data items, it may be a requirement that
any two key or two data items fit into available memory.  Finally, when
writing applications supporting transactions, it may be necessary to have
an additional copy of any data item in memory for logging purposes.
<p>
The maximum btree depth is 255.
