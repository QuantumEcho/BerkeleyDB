<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Programmer Notes</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Run-time configuration</h1>
<p>
There are two main ways of configuring Berkeley DB at run-time.  The first is
<a href="../../api_c/internal/db_jump_set.html">db_jump_set</a>, which allows applications to intercept Berkeley DB
requests for underlying library or system call functionality.  The second
is <a href="../../api_c/internal/db_value_set.html">db_value_set</a> which allows applications to re-configure, on an
application-wide basis, Berkeley DB behaviors.
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/internal/db_jump_set.html">db_jump_set</a> and <a href="../../api_c/internal/db_value_set.html">db_value_set</a> interfaces are only
available from the C API.
<p>
A not-uncommon problem for applications is the new API in Solaris 2.6 for
manipulating large files.  As this API was not part of Solaris 2.5, it is
difficult to create a single binary that takes advantage of the large file
functionality in Solaris 2.6 but which still run on Solaris 2.5.  Example
code that allows this, using the <a href="../../api_c/internal/db_jump_set.html">db_jump_set</a> interface, is included
<a href="solaris.txt">here</a>.
