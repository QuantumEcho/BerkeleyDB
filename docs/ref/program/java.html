<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Programmer Notes</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Java Programming Notes</h1>
<p>
The Java API closely parallels the Berkeley DB C++ interface, and to a great
degree, the Berkeley DB C interface.  If you are currently using either of those
APIs, there will be very little to surprise you in the Java API.  We've
even taken great care to make the names of classes, constants, methods,
and even method arguments identical, where possible, across all three
APIs.
<p>
If there are embedded null strings in the <b>db_config</b> argument for
<a href="../../api_java/DbEnv/appinit.html">DbEnv.appinit</a> they will be treated as the end of the list of config
strings, even though you may have allocated a longer array.  Fill in all
the strings in your array unless you intend to cut it short.  This same
comment applies to the <b>curslist</b> argument for <a href="../../api_java/Db/join.html">Db.join</a>.
<p>
The callback installed for <a href="../../api_java/DbEnv/set_errcall.html">DbEnv.set_errcall</a> will run in the same
thread as the caller to <a href="../../api_java/DbEnv/set_errcall.html">DbEnv.set_errcall</a>.  Make sure that thread
remains running until your application exits or <a href="../../api_java/DbEnv/appexit.html">DbEnv.appexit</a> is
called.
<p>
The Berkeley DB package requires that you explicitly call close on each
individual <a href="../../api_java/Db/class.html">Db</a>, <a href="../../api_java/Dbc/class.html">Dbc</a> that you obtained or any
<a href="../../api_java/DbLockTab/class.html">DbLockTab</a> or <a href="../../api_java/DbTxnMgr/class.html">DbTxnMgr</a> that you explicitly opened.  Your
database activity may not be synchronized to disk unless you do so.
<p>
The <a href="../../api_java/DbMpool/class.html">DbMpool</a> class has a small subset of the corresponding Berkeley DB
C++ functionality.  This has been provided to allow you to perform
certain administrative actions on underlying <a href="../../api_java/DbMpool/class.html">DbMpool</a> opened as a
consequence of <a href="../../api_java/DbEnv/appinit.html">DbEnv.appinit</a>.  Direct access to other <a href="../../api_java/DbMpool/class.html">DbMpool</a>
functionality is not appropriate for the Java environment.
<p>
The Java runtime <b>DOES NOT</b> automatically close Db* objects on
finalization, whether they be <a href="../../api_java/Db/class.html">Db</a>, <a href="../../api_java/Dbc/class.html">Dbc</a>, <a href="../../api_java/DbTxn/class.html">DbTxn</a>, etc.
There are a couple reasons for this.  One is that finalization is
generally run only when GC occurs and there is no guarantee that this
occurs at all (even on exit).  Allowing specific Berkeley DB actions to occur
in ways that cannot be replicated seems wrong.  Secondly, finalization of
objects may happen in an arbitrary order, so we would have to do a lot of
extra bookkeeping to make sure everything got closed in the proper order.
The best word of advice is to always do a close() for any matching open()
call or equivalent.
<p>
Berkeley DB always turns on the DB_THREAD flag since threads are
expected in Java.
<p>
Many methods in the API often have no return type, and throw an exception
when an severe error arises.  There are some notable methods that do have
a return value, and can also throw an exception.  <a href="../../api_java/Db/get.html">Db.get</a> and
<a href="../../api_java/Dbc/get.html">Dbc.get</a> both return 0 when a get succeeds, Db.DB_NOTFOUND
when the key is not found, and throw an error when there is a severe
error.  There are others.  This allows the programmer to check for typical
<i>data driven</i> errors by watching return values without special
casing exceptions.
