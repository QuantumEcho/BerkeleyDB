<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Programmer Notes</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Integrating version 1.85 applications</h1>
<p>
It is not difficult to upgrade Berkeley DB 1.85 applications to use the Berkeley DB
version 2 library.  The Berkeley DB version 2 library has a Berkeley DB 1.85
compatibility mode, which you can use by either recompiling your
application's source code or by relinking its object files against the
version 2 library.
<p>
<b> The underlying databases must be converted, however, as the
Berkeley DB version 2 library has a different underlying database format.</b>
<h1>System Integration</h1>
<ol>
<p><li>
It is possible to maintain both the Berkeley DB 1.85 and Berkeley DB version 2
libraries on your system.  However, the <b>db.h</b> include file
that was distributed with Berkeley DB 1.85 is <b>not</b> compatible with
the <b>db.h</b> file distributed with Berkeley DB version 2, so you will
have to install them in different locations.  In addition, both the
Berkeley DB 1.85 and Berkeley DB version 2 libraries are named <b>libdb.a</b>.
<p>
As the Berkeley DB 1.85 library did not have an installation target in the
Makefile, there's no way to know exactly where it was installed on the
system.  In addition, many vendors included it in the C library instead
of as a separate library, and so it may actually be part of <b>libc</b>
and the <b>db.h</b> include file may be installed in <b>/usr/include</b>.
<p>
For these reasons, the simplest way to maintain both libraries is to
install Berkeley DB version 2 in a completely separate area of your system.
The Berkeley DB version 2 installation process allows you to install into a
standalone directory hierarchy on your system.  See the
<a href="../../build/unix.html">Building for UNIX platforms</a> documentation
for more information and instructions on how to install the Berkeley DB version
2 library, include files and documentation into specific locations.
<p><li>
Alternatively, you can replace Berkeley DB 1.85 on your system with Berkeley DB
version 2.  In this case, you'll probably want to install Berkeley DB version
2 in the normal place on your system, wherever that may be, and delete
the Berkeley DB 1.85 include files, manual pages and libraries.
<p>
To replace 1.85 with version 2, you must either convert your 1.85
applications to use the version 2 API or build the Berkeley DB version 2 library
to include Berkeley DB 1.85 interface compatibility code.  Whether converting
your applications to use the version 2 interface or using the version 1.85
compatibility API, you will need to recompile or relink your 1.85
applications, and you must convert any persistent application databases
to the Berkeley DB version 2 database formats.
<p>
There is no requirement that you recompile your Berkeley DB 1.85 applications,
as you can simply link their object files against the Berkeley DB version 2
library.
<p>
If you want to recompile your Berkeley DB 1.85 applications, you will have to
change them to include the file <b>db_185.h</b> instead of
<b>db.h</b>.  (The <b>db_185.h</b> file is automatically installed
during the Berkeley DB version 2 installation process.)  You can then recompile
the applications, linking them against the Berkeley DB version 2 library.
<p>
For more information on compiling the Berkeley DB 1.85 compatibility code into
the Berkeley DB version 2 library, see <a href="../../build/unix.html">Building
for UNIX platforms</a>.
<p>
For more information on converting databases from the Berkeley DB 1.85 formats
to the Berkeley DB version 2 formats, see the <a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> and
<a href="../../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> documentation.
<p><li>
Finally, although we certainly do not recommend it, it is possible to load
both Berkeley DB 1.85 and Berkeley DB version 2 into the same library.  Similarly, it
is possible to use both Berkeley DB 1.85 and Berkeley DB version 2 within a single
application, although it's not possible to use them from within the same
file.
<p>
The name space in Berkeley DB version 2 has been changed from that of previous
Berkeley DB versions, notably version 1.85, for portability and consistency
reasons.  The only name collisions in the two libraries are the names used
by the historic <a href="../../api_c/historic/dbm.html">dbm</a>, <a href="../../api_c/historic/dbm.html">ndbm</a> and <a href="../../api_c/historic/hsearch.html">hsearch</a> interfaces,
and the Berkeley DB 1.85 compatibility interfaces in the Berkeley DB version 2
library.
<p>
If you are loading both Berkeley DB 1.85 and Berkeley DB version 2 into a single
library, remove the historic interfaces from one of the two library
builds, and configure the Berkeley DB version 2 build to not include the Berkeley DB
1.85 compatibility API, otherwise you could have collisions and undefined
behavior.  This can be done by editing the library Makefiles and
reconfiguring and rebuilding the Berkeley DB version 2 library.  Obviously, if
you use the historic interfaces, you will get the version in the library
from which you did not remove it.  Similarly, you will not be able to
access Berkeley DB version 2 files using the Berkeley DB 1.85 compatibility interface,
since you have removed that from the library as well.
</ol>
<h1>Converting Applications</h1>
Mapping the Berkeley DB 1.85 functionality into Berkeley DB version 2 is almost always
a simple, one-to-one mapping.  The manual page <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> replaces
the Berkeley DB 1.85 manual pages <b>dbopen</b>(3), <b>btree</b>(3),
<b>hash</b>(3) and <b>recno</b>(3).  You should be able to convert
each 1.85 function call into a Berkeley DB version 2 function call using just
the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> documentation.
<p>
Some guidelines and things to watch out for:
<ol>
<p><li>
Most access method functions have exactly the same semantics as in Berkeley DB
1.85, although the arguments to the functions have changed in some cases.
To get your code to compile, the most common change is to add the
transaction ID as an argument (NULL, since Berkeley DB 1.85 did not support
transactions).
<p><li>
You must always initialize DBT structures to zero before using them
with any Berkeley DB version 2 function.  (They do not normally have to be
reinitialized each time, only when they are first allocated.  Do this by
declaring the DBT structure external or static, or by calling the C
library routine <b>bzero</b>(3) or <b>memset</b>(3).
<p><li>
The error returns are completely different in the two versions.  In Berkeley DB
1.85, < 0 meant an error, and > 0 meant a minor Berkeley DB exception.  In Berkeley DB
2.0, > 0 means an error (the Berkeley DB version 2 functions return
<b>errno</b> on error) and < 0 means a Berkeley DB exception.  See
<a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html">Error Returns to Applications</a> for
more information.
<p><li>
The Berkeley DB 1.85 <b>seq()</b> function has been replaced by cursors in
Berkeley DB version 2.  The semantics are approximately the same, but cursors
require the creation of an extra object (the DBC * object), which is then
used to access the database.
<p>
Specifically, the partial key match and range search functionality of the
R_CURSOR flag in <b>db->seq()</b> has been replaced by the
<a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html#DB_SET_RANGE">DB_SET_RANGE</a> flag in <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html">DBcursor->c_get</a>.
<p><li>
In version 2 of the Berkeley DB library, additions or deletions into Recno
(fixed and variable-length record) databases no longer automatically
logically renumber all records after the add/delete point, by default.
The default behavior is that deleting records does not cause subsequent
records to be renumbered, and it is an error to attempt to add new records
between records already in the database.  Applications wanting the
historic recno access method semantics should specify the
<a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag in the DB_INFO structure.
<p><li>
Opening a database in Berkeley DB version 2 is a much heavier-weight operation
than it was in Berkeley DB 1.85.  Therefore, if your historic applications were
written to open a database, perform a single operation, and close the
database, you may observe performance degradation.  In most cases, this
is due to the expense of creating the environment upon each open.   While
we encourage restructuring your application to avoid repeated opens and
closes, you can probably recover most of the lost performance by simply
using a persistent environment across invocations.
</ol>
<p>
While simply converting Berkeley DB 1.85 function calls to Berkeley DB version 2
function calls will work, we recommend that you eventually reconsider your
application's interface to the Berkeley DB database library in light of the
additional functionality supplied by Berkeley DB version 2, as it is likely to
result in enhanced application performance.
