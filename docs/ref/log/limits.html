<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Logging Subsystem</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Log file limits</h1>
<p>
Log file sizes impose a time limit on the length of time a database
may be accessed under transaction protection, before it needs to be
dumped and reloaded (see <a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> and <a href="../../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a>).
Unfortunately, the limits are potentially difficult to calculate.
<p>
The log file name consists of <b>log.</b> followed by 10 digits,
with a maximum of 2,000,000,000 log files.
Consider an application performing 3000 transactions per second, for
24 hours a day, logged into 10Mb log files, where each transaction
is logging approximately 500 bytes of data.  The calculation:
<p><ul><pre>(10 * 2^20 * 2000000000) / (3000 * 500 * 365 * 60 * 60 * 24) = ~443</pre></ul><p>
indicates that the system will run out of log file names in
roughly 443 years.
<p>
There is no way to reset the log file name space in Berkeley DB.
If your application is reaching the end of its log file name space,
you should:
<ol>
<p><li>Archive your databases as if to prepare for catastrophic failure (see
<a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> for more information).
<p><li>Dump and re-load <b>all</b> your databases (see
<a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> and <a href="../../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> for more information).
<p><li>Remove all of the log files from the database environment (see
<a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> for more information).
<p><li>Restart your applications.
</ol>
