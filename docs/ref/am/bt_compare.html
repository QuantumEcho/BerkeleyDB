<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Access Methods</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Btree comparison function (bt_compare)</h1>
<p>
The Btree data structure is a sorted, balanced tree structure storing
associated key/data pairs.
<p>
The sort order for the Btree can be specified as part of the
<a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call to open the database, specifically by setting the
<a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#bt_compare">bt_compare</a> element of the DB_INFO structure.  If no
comparison routine is specified, the sort order is lexical, with shorter
keys collating before longer keys.
<p>
Sort routines are passed pointers to keys as arguments.  The keys are
represented as DBT structures.  The routine must return an integer
less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first argument is
considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the
second argument.  The only fields that the routines may examine in the
DBT structures are <b>data</b> and <b>size</b> fields.
<p>
An example routine that might be used to sort integer keys in the database
is as follows:
<p><ul><pre>
compare_int(a, b)
	const DBT *a, *b;
{
	int ai, bi;
<p>
	/*
	 * Returns:
	 *	< 0 if a < b
	 *	= 0 if a = b
	 *	> 0 if a > b
	 */
	memcpy(&ai, a->data, sizeof(int));
	memcpy(&bi, b->data, sizeof(int));
	return (ai - bi);
}
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
Note that the data must first be copied into memory that is
appropriately aligned, as Berkeley DB does not guarantee any kind of
alignment of the underlying data, including for comparison
routines.
<p>
When doing integer comparison routines, it is important to remember
that databases created on machines of different architectures may
have different integer byte orders, for which your code may need to
compensate.
<p>
An example routine that might be used to sort keys based on the first
five bytes of the key (ignoring any subsequent keys) is as follows:
<p><ul><pre>
compare_dbt(a, b)
	const DBT *a, *b;
{
	u_char *p1, *p2;
<p>
	/*
	 * Returns:
	 *	< 0 if a < b
	 *	= 0 if a = b
	 *	> 0 if a > b
	 */
	for (p1 = a->data, p2 = b->data, len = 5; len--; ++p1, ++p2)
		if (*p1 != *p2)
			return ((long)*p1 - (long)*p2);
	return (0);
}
</pre></ul><p>
