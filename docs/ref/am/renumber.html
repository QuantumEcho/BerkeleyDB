<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Access Methods</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Logically renumbering records (DB_RENUMBER)</h1>
<p>
Records stored in the Recno access method are accessed by logical record
number.  By default, these record numbers are not mutable.  What that
means is if you delete record number 5, record number 6 is not
automatically renumbered to be record number 5 and 7 renumbered to be
record number 6 and so on.  For the same reason, new records cannot be
inserted inbetween already existing records.
<p>
It is possible to make the logical record numbers mutable by specifying
the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag in the DB_INFO structure during the
<a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call to open the database.  This means that the record
numbers may change change as records are added to and deleted from the
database.
<p>
For example, the deletion of record number 4 causes records numbered 5
and greater to be renumbered downward by 1.  If a cursor was positioned
to record number 4 before the deletion, it will suddenly reference the
new record number 4, if any such record exists, after the deletion. If a
cursor was positioned after record number 4 before the deletion, it will
be shifted downward 1 logical record, continuing to reference the same
record as it did before.
<p>
Similarly, if a created record is not at the end of the database, all
records following the new record will be automatically renumbered upward
by 1. For example, the creation of a new record numbered 8 causes records
numbered 8 and greater to be renumbered upward by 1. If a cursor was
positioned to record number 8 or greater before the insertion, it will be
shifted upward 1 logical record, continuing to reference the same record
as it did before.
<p>
For these reasons, concurrent access to a Recno database with the
<a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag specified may be largely meaningless, although
it is supported.
<p>
In the case of Recno databases where record numbers are not mutable,
any attempt to retrieve deleted records will result in a special error
return, DB_KEYEMPTY.
<p>
When using both mutable and immutable record numbers, creating new records
will cause the creation of multiple records if the record number is more
than one greater than the largest record currently in the database. For
example, creating record number 28, when record 25 was previously the
last record in the database, will create records 26 and 27 as well as 28.
<p>
First, last, next and previous cursor operations will automatically skip
over implicitly created records.  For example, if record number 5 is the
only record the application has created, implicitly creating records 1
through 4, the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html">DBcursor->c_get</a> interface with the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html#DB_FIRST">DB_FIRST</a> flag
will return record number 5, not record number 1.  Attempts to explicitly
retrieve records that were created in this manner will result in a special
error return, DB_KEYEMPTY.
