<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Access Methods</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Record delimiters (re_delim, DB_DELIMITER)</h1>
<p>
The Recno access method can be used to store both variable and
fixed-length data items.  By default, the data items are expected
to be variable length.
<p>
When reading variable length records from a <a href="re_source.html">backing
source file</a> to store in the database, a delimiter character may be set
as part of the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call to open the database, specifically
by setting the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#re_delim">re_delim</a> element of the DB_INFO structure.
Because there is no out-of-band value for this character, the
<a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_DELIMITER">DB_DELIMITER</a> flag must also be set.
<p>
If an application is reading variable length records from a backing
source file to store in the database and the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_DELIMITER">DB_DELIMITER</a> flag
is not set, a newline character (i.e., 0x0a in the ASCII character set)
is used as the delimiter.
