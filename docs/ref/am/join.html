<h1 align=center>Logical join</h1>
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/Db/join.html">DB->join</a> function provides logical join functionality.  While
not strictly a cursor function, in that it is not a method off a
cursor handle, it is more related to the cursor functions than to
the standard DB functions.
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/Db/join.html">DB->join</a> function requires that your data be organized as a primary
database which contains the primary key and primary data field, and a set
of secondary databases.  Each of the secondary databases is indexed by a
different secondary key, and, for each key in a secondary database, there
is a set of duplicate data items that match the primary keys in the
primary database.
<p>
What the <a href="../../api_c/Db/join.html">DB->join</a> function does is review a list of secondary keys, and,
when it finds a data item that appears as a data item for all of the
secondary keys, it uses that data items as a lookup into the primary
database, and returns the associated data item.
<p>
For example, consider a database that lists types of fruit as the key item,
and the store where you can buy them as the data item:
<p><ul><pre>
<b>Key:</b>		<b>Data:</b>
apple		Convenience Store
peach		Shopway
pear		Farmer's Market
raspberry	Shopway
strawberry	Farmer's Market
blueberry	Farmer's Market
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
A secondary index might have a key <b>color</b>, and, as the data
items, the list of fruits of different colors.
<p><ul><pre>
<b>Key:</b>		<b>Data:</b>
red		apple, raspberry, strawberry
yellow		peach, pear
blue		blueberry
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
This secondary index would allow an application to look up a color, and
then use the data items to look up the stores where the colored fruit
could be purchased, e.g., by first looking up <b>blue</b>, the data
item <b>blueberry</b> could be used as the lookup key in the primary
database, returning <b>Farmer's Market</b>.
<p>
If there were a another secondary index that had as its key the
<b>cost</b> of the fruit, a similar lookup could be done on stores
where inexpensive fruit could be purchased:
<p><ul><pre>
<b>Key:</b>		<b>Data:</b>
expensive	blueberry, peach, pear, strawberry
inexpensive	apple, pear, raspberry
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/Db/join.html">DB->join</a> function, makes it possible to do lookups based on multiple
criteria in a single operation, e.g., it would be possible to look up
fruits that were both red and expensive in a single operation.  If the
same fruit appeared as a data item in both the color and expense indices,
then that fruit name would be used as the key for retrieval from the
primary index, and would then return the store where expensive, red fruit
could be purchased.
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>
Consider the following three databases:
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>personnel<dd>
<ul type=disc>
<li>key = SSN
<li>data = record containing name, address, phone number, job title
</ul>
<dt>lastname<dd>
<ul type=disc>
<li>key = lastname
<li>data = SSN
</ul>
<dt>jobs<dd>
<ul type=disc>
<li>key = job title
<li>data = SSN
</ul>
</dl>
<p>
Consider the following query:
<p>
<p><ul><pre>Return all smiths who are managers.</pre></ul><p>
<p>
What is desired are all the records in the primary database (personnel)
for whom the criteria <b>lastname=smith, job title=manager</b> is
true.
<p>
Assume that all databases have been properly opened and have the
handles: pers_db, name_db, job_db.  Assume that we have an active
transaction referenced by the handle txn.
<p>
<p><ul><pre>
DBC *name_curs, *job_curs, *join_curs;
DBC *carray[3];
DBT key, data;
int ret, tret;
<p>
name_curs = NULL;
job_curs = NULL;
memset(&key, 0, sizeof(key));
memset(&data, 0, sizeof(data));
<p>
if ((ret = name_db->cursor(name_db, txn, &name_curs)) != 0)
	goto err;
key.data = "smith";
key.size = sizeof("smith");
if ((ret = name_curs->c_get(name_curs, &key, &data, DB_SET)) != 0)
	goto err;
<p>
if ((ret = job_db->cursor(job_db, txn, &job_curs)) != 0)
	goto err;
key.data = "manager";
key.size = sizeof("manager");
if ((ret = job_curs->c_get(job_curs, &key, &data, DB_SET)) != 0)
	goto err;
<p>
carray[0] = name_curs;
carray[1] = job_curs;
carray[2] = NULL;
<p>
if ((ret = pers_db->join(pers_db, carray, 0, &join_curs)) != 0)
	goto err;
<p>
while ((ret = join_curs->c_get(join_curs, &key, &data, 0)) == 0) {
	/* Process record returned in key/data. */
}
<p>
/*
 * If we exited the loop because we ran out of records,
 * then it has completed successfully.
 */
if (ret == DB_NOTFOUND)
	ret = 0;
<p>
err:
if (join_curs != NULL &&
    (tret = join_curs->c_close(join_curs)) != 0 && ret == 0)
	ret = tret;
if (name_curs != NULL && 
    (tret = name_curs->c_close(name_curs)) != 0 && ret == 0)
	ret = tret;
if (job_curs != NULL &&
    (tret = job_curs->c_close(job_curs)) != 0 && ret == 0)
	ret = tret;
return (ret);
