<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Access Methods</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Selecting a cache size</h1>
<p>
The size of the cache used for the underlying database can be specified
as part of the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call to open the database, specifically by
setting the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#db_cachesize">db_cachesize</a> element of the DB_INFO structure.
<p>
Choosing a cache size is, unfortunately, an art.  Your cache <b>must</b>
be at least large enough for your working set plus some overlap for
unexpected situations.
<p>
When using the Btree access method, you <b>must</b> have a cache big
enough for the minimum working set for a single access.  This will include
a root page, one or more internal pages (depending on the depth of your
tree), and a leaf page.  If your cache is any smaller than that, each new
page will force out the least-recently-used page, and you'll end up
requesting the root page of the tree anew on each database request.
<p>
If your keys are of moderate size (a few tens of bytes) and your pages
are on the order of 4K to 8K, most Btrees will be only three levels
(e.g., if we assume 20 byte keys with 20 bytes of data associated with
each key, a 8KB page can hold roughly 400 keys and 200 key/data pairs,
so a fully populated three level Btree will hold 32 million key/data
pairs, and a tree with only a 50% page-fill factore will still hold 16
million key/data pairs).
We rarely expect trees to exceed five levels, although Berkeley DB will
support trees up to 255 levels.
<p>
Even a small initial increase of the size of the cache over the minimum
working set gives you a good return, as this allows you to cache more
internal pages, which are more likely to be accessed in a Btree requests
than any single leaf page.
<p>
Regardless, the rule-of-thumb is that cache is good, and more cache is
better.  Generally, applications benefit from increasing the cache size
up to a point, where the performance will stop increasing when the cache
size increases, or, that the performance will only increase a very little
bit in response to increasing the cache size.  When this point is reached,
one of two things have happened: First, either the cache is large enough
that the application is almost never having to retrieve information from
disk.  Second, your application is doing truly random accesses, and
therefore increasing size of the cache doesn't significantly increase the
odds of finding the next requested information in the cache.  The latter
is fairly rare -- almost all applications show some form of locality of
reference!
<p>
For example, even if our accesses are truly random within a B+-tree, your
access pattern will favor internal pages to leaf pages, so your cache
should be large enough to hold all internal pages.  This will result in
your requiring at most one I/O per operation to retrieve the appropriate
leaf page.
<p>
Finally, you can use the <a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility to monitor the effectiveness
of your cache.  The following output is excerpted from the output of that
utility's <b>-m</b> option:
<p><ul><pre>
prompt> db_stat -m
131072  Cache size (128K).
4273    Requested pages found in the cache (97%).
134     Requested pages not found in the cache.
18      Pages created in the cache.
116     Pages read into the cache.
93      Pages written from the cache to the backing file.
5       Clean pages forced from the cache.
13      Dirty pages forced from the cache.
0       Dirty buffers written by trickle-sync thread.
130     Current clean buffer count.
4       Current dirty buffer count.
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The statistics for this cache are that there have been 4,273 requests of
the cache, and only 116 of those requests required an I/O from disk.  This
means that the cache is working well, yielding a 97% cache hit rate.  The
<a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility will present these statistics both for the cache
as a whole and for each file within the cache separately.
