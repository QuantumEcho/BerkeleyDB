<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Access Methods</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Selecting a byte order</h1>
<p>
The database files created by Berkeley DB can be created in either little or
big-endian formats.
<p>
The byte order used for the underlying database can be specified as part
of the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call to open the database, specifically by setting
the <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#db_lorder">db_lorder</a> element of the DB_INFO structure.  If no
order is selected, the native format of the machine on which the database
is created will be used.
<p>
Berkeley DB databases are architecture independent, and any format database can
be used on a machine with a different native format.  In this case, as
each page that is read into or written from the cache must be converted
to/from the host format, it is possible that databases with non-native
formats will incur a performance penalty for the run-time conversion.
<p>
<b>It is important to note that the Berkeley DB access methods do no data
conversion for application specified data, i.e., key/data pairs written
on a little-endian format architecture will be returned to the application
exactly as they were written, on a big-endian format architecture.</b>
