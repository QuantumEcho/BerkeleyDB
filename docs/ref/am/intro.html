<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Access Methods</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>What are the available access methods?</h1>
<p>
Berkeley DB currently offers three access methods: Btree, Hash and Recno.
<h1>Btree</h1>
<p>
The Btree access method is an implementation of a sorted, balanced tree
structure, more specifically a B+tree.  Searches, insertions, and
deletions in the tree all take O(log base_b N) time, where base_b is the
average number of keys per page, and N is the total number of keys stored.
Often, inserting ordered data into btree implementations results in pages
that are half-full.  This implementation has been modified to make ordered
(or inverse ordered) insertion the best case, resulting in nearly perfect
page space utilization.
<p>
Space freed by deleting key/data pairs from a Btree database is never
reclaimed from the filesystem, although it is reused where possible.  This
means that the Btree storage structure is grow-only.  If sufficiently many
keys are deleted from a tree that shrinking the underlying database file
is desirable, this can be accomplished by creating a new tree from a scan
of the existing one.
<h1>Hash</h1>
<p>
The Hash access method data structure is an implementation of Extended
Linear Hashing, as described in
<i>Linear Hashing: A New Tool for File and Table Addressing</i>,
Witold Litwin, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Very
Large Databases (VLDB), 1980.
<h1>Recno</h1>
<p>
The Recno access method is an implementation of Fixed and Variable-length
records, optionally backed by a flat text (byte stream) file.  Both fixed
and variable length records are accessed by their logical record number.
<p>
It is valid to create a record whose record number is more than one
greater than the last record currently in the database.  For example,
the creation of record number 8, when records 6 and 7 do not yet exist,
is not an error.  However, any attempt to retrieve such records (e.g.,
records 6 and 7) will fail.
<p>
By default, deleting a record will not renumber records following the
deleted record.  Any attempt to retrieve deleted records will fail.
