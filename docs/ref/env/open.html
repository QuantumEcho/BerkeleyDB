<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Environment</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Opening databases within the environment</h1>
<p>
Once the environment has been created, the returned handle should be
passed as an argument to the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call.  This causes the
database being opened to be opened within the environment.  File naming
and database operations will all be done as specified for the environment,
e.g., if the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a> flag was specified when the environment
was created or joined, database operations will automatically perform all
necessary locking operations for the application.
