<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Environment</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Shared Memory Regions</h1>
<p>
Each of the Berkeley DB subsystems is described by one or more shared memory
regions.  These regions live in the environment home directory, and
contain all of the shared information, including mutexes, that describes
the Berkeley DB environment.
<p>
The Berkeley DB library uses the POSIX mmap (or other similar) interface to map
the shared memory regions.  Most remote file systems (e.g., the Network
File System (NFS) and the Andrew File System (AFS)), do not support
mapping files into process memory.  For this reason, we strongly recommend
that the database home directory reside in a local filesystem.
<p>
For remote file systems that do allow system files to be mapped into
process memory, it is important to note that home directories accessed
via remote file systems cannot be used simultaneously from multiple
clients.  None of the commercial remote file systems available today
implement a coherent, distributed shared memory paradigm for
remote-mounted files.  As a result, different machines will see different
versions of these shared regions and the system behavior is undefined.
<p>
Databases, log files and temporary files may be placed on remote
filesystems, although the application may incur a performance penalty
for doing so.
