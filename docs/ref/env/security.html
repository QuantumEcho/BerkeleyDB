<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Environment</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Security</h1>
<p>
There are two important security concerns when writing Berkeley DB applications.
<p>
The first is the directory used as the database home environment.  It is
important that the environment home directory be carefully created to have
the correct permissions for the system to ensure that databases are not
accessible to users without the correct permissions.  Berkeley DB never creates
the database home directory, it must be created before the application is
run.
<p>
The second is the use of environment variables in file naming, i.e.,
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON">DB_USE_ENVIRON</a> and <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT">DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT</a>.  If a Berkeley DB
application is running with additional permissions, (e.g., UNIX setuid or
setgid permissions), and either of these variables is set, users could
potentially cause the application to read and write databases to which
the user would not normally have access.
<p>
By default, Berkeley DB always creates files readable and writeable by the owner
and the group (i.e., S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP and S_IWGRP, or octal mode
0660 on historic UNIX systems).  The group ownership of created files is
based on the system and directory defaults, and is not further specified
by Berkeley DB.
