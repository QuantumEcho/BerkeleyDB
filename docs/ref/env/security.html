<h1 align=center>Security</h1>
<p>
There are two important security concerns when writing Berkeley DB applications:
<ol>
<p><li>The first concern is the directory used as the database home environment.
It is important that the environment home directory be carefully created
to have the correct permissions for the system to ensure that databases
are not accessible to users without the correct permissions.
<p><li>The second concern is the use of environment variables in file naming,
e.g., <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON">DB_USE_ENVIRON</a> and <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT">DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT</a>.  If a Berkeley DB
application is running with additional permissions, (e.g., UNIX setuid or
setgid permissions), and either of these variables is set, users could
potentially cause the application to read and write databases to which
the user would not normally have access.
<p>
By default, Berkeley DB always creates files readable and writeable by the owner
and the group (i.e., S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP and S_IWGRP, or octal mode
0660 on historic UNIX systems).  The group ownership of created files is
based on the system and directory defaults, and is not further specified
by Berkeley DB.
<p>
Finally, if an unnamed database is created and the cache is too small to
hold the database in memory, Berkeley DB will create a temporary physical file
to enable it to page the database to disk as needed.  In this case,
environment variables such as <b>TMPDIR</b> may be used to specify the
location of that temporary file.  While temporary backing files are
created readable and writeable by the owner only (i.e., S_IRUSR and
S_IWUSR, or octal mode 0600 on historic UNIX systems), some filesystems
may not sufficiently protect temporary files created in random directories
from improper access.  Applications storing sensitive data in unnamed
databases should probably specify the <a href="../../ref/env/naming.html#DB_TMP_DIR">DB_TMP_DIR</a> configuration
value to be absolutely safe.
