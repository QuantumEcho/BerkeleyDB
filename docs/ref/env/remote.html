<h3 align=center>Remote filesystem</h3>
<p>When regions are backed by the filesystem, it is a common error to attempt
to create Berkeley DB environments backed by remote filesystems such as the
Network File System (NFS) or the Andrew File System (AFS).  Remote
filesystems rarely support mapping files into process memory, and even
more rarely support correct semantics for mutexes after the attempt
succeeds.  For this reason, we strongly recommend that the database
environment directory reside in a local filesystem.</p>
<p>For remote filesystems that do allow system files to be mapped into
process memory, home directories accessed via remote filesystems cannot
be used simultaneously from multiple clients.  None of the commercial
remote filesystems available today implement coherent, distributed
shared memory for remote-mounted files.  As a result, different machines
will see different versions of these shared regions, and the system
behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>Databases, log files, and temporary files may be placed on remote
filesystems, <b>as long as the remote filesystem fully supports
standard POSIX filesystem semantics</b> (although the application may
incur a performance penalty for doing so).  Obviously, NFS-mounted
databases cannot be accessed from more than one Berkeley DB environment at a
time (and therefore from more than one system), because no Berkeley DB
database may be accessed from more than one Berkeley DB environment at a
time.</p>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>FreeBSD note:<dd>Some FreeBSD releases are known to return ENOLCK from fsync and close
calls on NFS-mounted filesystems, even though the call has succeeded.
The Berkeley DB code should be modified to ignore ENOLCK errors, or no Berkeley DB
files should be placed on NFS-mounted filesystems on these systems.
<p><dt>Linux note:<dd>Some Linux releases are known to not support complete semantics for the
POSIX fsync call on NFS-mounted filesystems.  No Berkeley DB files should be
placed on NFS-mounted filesystems on these systems.
