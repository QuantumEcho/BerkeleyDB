<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Environment</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Creating an Environment</h1>
<p>
The <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a> function is the standard function for creating
or joining a database environment.
Every transaction-protected or multi-process application should call
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a> before making any other calls to the Berkeley DB library.
<p>
There are several flags that you can set to customize <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>:
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_CREATE">DB_CREATE</a><dd>Create underlying files as necessary.  This flag is normally specified
by applications that have the right to create the region and not by those
that simply want to join it if it already exists.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a><dd>Applications reading and writing databases opened in this environment
will be using locking to ensure that they do not overwrite each other's
changes.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOG">DB_INIT_LOG</a><dd>Applications reading and writing databases opened in this environment
will be using logging.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a><dd>The databases opened in the environment should use a shared underlying
memory pool.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a><dd>Applications reading and writing databases opened in this environment
may be using transactions.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE">DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE</a><dd>Create a private memory pool, not shared by other processes.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_NOMMAP">DB_NOMMAP</a><dd>
Files that are opened read-only in the pool (and that satisfy a few other
criteria) are, by default, mapped into the process address space instead
of being copied into the local cache.  This can enhance performance or
degrade it, depending on the architecture where it is done.  Setting the
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_NOMMAP">DB_NOMMAP</a> flag causes Berkeley DB to never map such files into memory,
instead, they are read into the cache using the standard read system calls.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a><dd>Run normal recovery on this environment before opening it for normal use.
Normal recovery is sufficient to handle most application or system failures.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a><dd>Run catastrophic recovery on this environment before opening it for
normal use.  Catastrophic recovery is necessary when restoring a database
from an archive.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_THREAD">DB_THREAD</a><dd>Ensure that handles returned by the Berkeley DB subsystems are useable
by multiple threads within a single process, i.e., that the system is
free-threaded.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_TXN_NOSYNC">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</a><dd>On transaction commit, do not synchronously flush the log.  This means
that Berkeley DB will provide atomicity, consistency, and isolation for your
transactions, but not durability.  Upon recovery, some previously committed
transactions may be lost, but your database will be restored to a consistent
state.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON">DB_USE_ENVIRON</a><dd>Use environment variables as part of file naming.
<p><dt><a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT">DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT</a><dd>Use environment variables as part of file naming for users with
appropriate privileges.
</dl>
<p>
Almost all applications either specify only the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a>
flag or they specify all four flags, <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a>,
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>, <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOG">DB_INIT_LOG</a> and <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a>.
The former configuration is for applications that simply want to use the
basic Access Method interfaces with a shared underlying buffer pool, but
don't care about recoverability after failure.  The latter is for
applications that need recoverability.  There are situations where other
combinations of the initialization flags make sense, but they are quite
rare.
<p>
The flag <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a> is specified by applications that want to
perform any necessary database recovery when they start running, i.e., if
there was a system or application failure the last time they ran, they
want the databases to be made consistent before they start running again.
(It is not an error to specify this flag when no recovery needs to be
done.)  The flag <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> is more special-purpose.  It
performs catastrophic database recovery, and normally requires that some
initial arrangements be made, i.e., archived log files be brought back
into the filesystem.  Applications should not normally specify this flag.
Instead, under these rare conditions, the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility
should be used.
