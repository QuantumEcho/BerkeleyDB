<h1 align=center>Introduction</h1>
<p>
As Berkeley DB is an embedded library, debugging applications that use Berkeley DB
can be tricky.  When a problem arises, it is not always readily apparent
whether the problem is in the application, in the database library, or is
a result of an unexpected interaction between the two.  This chapter is
intended to assist you in debugging applications and in reporting bugs to
us in a manner such that we can provide you with the correct answer or fix as
quickly as possible.
<p>
When you encounter a problem, there are a few general actions you can
take:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>Review the Berkeley DB error output<dd>If an error output mechanism has been configured in the Berkeley DB
environment, additional run-time error messages are made available to the
applications.  If you are not using an environment, it is well
worth modifying your application to create one so that you can get more
detailed error messages.  See <a href="runtime.html">Run-time error information</a>
for more information on configuring Berkeley DB to output these error messages.
<p><dt>Review <a href="../../api_c/env_set_verbose.html">DBENV-&gt;set_verbose</a><dd>Check the list of flags for the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_verbose.html">DBENV-&gt;set_verbose</a> function, and
see if any of them will produce additional information that might help
understand the problem.
<p><dt>Add run-time diagnostics<dd>You can configure and build Berkeley DB to perform run-time diagnostics.
(These checks are not done by default as they can seriously impact
performance.  See <a href="compile.html">Compile-time configuration</a> for more
information.
<p><dt>Apply all available patches<dd>Before reporting a problem to Sleepycat Software, please apply all of the
updates that are available for your release from the
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/update/index.html">Sleepycat Software</a> web
site.
<p><dt>Run the test suite<dd>If you are seeing repeated failures, or failures of simple test cases,
run the Berkeley DB test suite to determine if the distribution of Berkeley DB you
are using is installed and configured correctly.
