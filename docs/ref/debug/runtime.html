<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Debugging</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Run-time Error Information</h1>
<p>
Normally, when an error occurs in the Berkeley DB library, an
<b>errno</b> value is returned by the function.  In some cases,
however, this value may be insufficient to completely describe the
cause of the error, especially during initial application debugging.
<p>
There are four additional configuration options intended to provide
applications with additional run-time error information.  They are
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#db_errcall">db_errcall</a>, <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#db_errfile">db_errfile</a>, <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#db_errpfx">db_errpfx</a> and
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#db_verbose">db_verbose</a>.
<p>
If these options are configured when the environment is first
initialized by calling <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>, many Berkeley DB errors
will result in additional information being written to a file
or passed as an argument to an application function.
<p>
The Berkeley DB error reporting facility does not slow performance or
significantly increase application size, and may be run during normal
operation as well as during debugging.  Where possible, we recommend that
these options always be configured and the output saved in the filesystem.
We have found that that this often saves time when debugging installation
or other system integration problems.
