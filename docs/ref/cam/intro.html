<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Berkeley DB Concurrent Access Methods Applications</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Building concurrent access method applications</h1>
<p>
It is often desirable to have concurrent access to a database where there
is no need for full recoverability or transaction semantics.  For this
class of applications, Berkeley DB provides an interface supporting
multiple-reader/single writer semantics on the database.  This means that,
at any instant in time, there may be either multiple readers accessing
data or a single writer modifying data.  The application is entirely
unaware of which is happening, and Berkeley DB implements the necessary locking
and blocking to ensure these semantics.
<p>
This chapter describes how to create concurrent access applications using
Berkeley DB.
<p>
In order to create concurrent applications, you must first initialize an
environment by calling <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>.  You must specify the
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_CDB">DB_INIT_CDB</a> flag to that interface, and you may optionally also
specify the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a> flag.  (If your application is doing
concurrent access via a single multi-threaded process,
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a> will not be necessary, however, in the case of
multiple processes sharing a database, it is.) As concurrent applications
are <b>not</b> recoverable, you should not specify any of the other
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a> subsystem configuration flags, e.g., you should not
DB_INIT_LOCK, DB_INIT_LOG, DB_INIT_TXN, DB_RECOVER or DB_RECOVER_FATAL.
<p>
The DB_ENV structure returned by <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a> must then be
passed to all of the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> calls made by your application.
<p>
The Berkeley DB access method calls used to support concurrent access are
unchanged from the normal access method calls, with one exception, the
<a href="../../api_c/Db/cursor.html">DB->cursor</a> interface.  In the Berkeley DB Concurrent Access Methods product, each cursor must
encapsulate the idea of being used for read-only access or for read-write
access.  There may only be one read-write cursor active at any one time.
When your application creates a cursor, if that cursor will ever be used
for writing, the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html#DB_RMW">DB_RMW</a> flag must be specified when the cursor
is created.
<p>
Because only a single thread of control may write the database at a time,
care must be taken to ensure that applications do not inadvertently block
themselves.  Some common mistakes are:
<ol>
<p><li>Leaving a cursor open while issuing a <a href="../../api_c/Db/put.html">DB->put</a> or <a href="../../api_c/Db/del.html">DB->del</a>
access method call.
<p><li>Attempting to open a cursor for read-write access while already holding
a cursor open for read-write access.
<p><li>Not testing Berkeley DB error return codes (if any cursor operation returns an
unexpected error, that cursor should be closed).
</ol>
<p>
Note that it is correct operation for two different threads of control
(actual threads or processes) have multiple read-write cursors open,
or for one thread to issue a <a href="../../api_c/Db/put.html">DB->put</a> call while another thread
has a read-write cursor open, and it is only a problem if these things
are done in a single thread of control.
