<h3 align=center>Architecting Data Store and Concurrent Data Store applications</h3>
<p>When building Data Store and Concurrent Data Store applications, there
are two special issues to consider whenever any thread of control exits
for any reason with a Berkeley DB database or database environment open.</p>
<p>First, unexpected application or system failure may result in lost data,
corruption or inconsistencies in Berkeley DB databases.  When a thread of
control exits while holding Berkeley DB resources, all databases (modified
since the database was last flushed to disk), should be either:</p>
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>removed and re-created,
<li>removed and restored from the last known good backup,
<li>verified using the <a href="../../api_c/db_verify.html">DB-&gt;verify</a> method or <a href="../../utility/db_verify.html">db_verify</a> utility.  If
the database does not verify cleanly, the contents may be salvaged using
the <b>-R</b> and <b>-r</b> options of the <a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a>
utility.
</ul>
<p>Applications where this is unacceptable should consider the Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store
product, which offers standard transactional guarantees such as
recoverability after failure.</p>
<p>Second, unexpected application or system failure requires that any
persistent database environment (that is, any database environment not
created using the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag), be removed to recover the
Berkeley DB resources and release any locks or mutexes that may have been held
to avoid starvation as the remaining threads of control block behind the
failed thread's locks or mutexes.</p>
<p>The Berkeley DB library cannot determine when to remove and re-create a
database environment; the application must make that decision.
Furthermore, database environment removal must be single-threaded; that
is, one thread of control or process must remove and re-create the
database environment before any other thread of control or process
attempts to join the Berkeley DB environment.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to handling this problem:</p>
<dl compact>
<dt>The hard way:<dd>Applications can track their own state carefully enough that they know
when the database environment needs to be removed and re-created.
Specifically, the rule to use is that any persistent database
environment must be removed any time the threads of control previously
using the Berkeley DB environment did not shut the environment down cleanly
before exiting the environment for any reason (including application or
system failure).
<dt>The easy way:<dd>It is almost invariably simpler to remove and re-create the database
environment each time a thread of control accessing a database
environment fails for any reason.  This requires the application detect
application or system failure, of course, and remove and re-create the
database environment on application, when appropriate.
</dl>
<p>There are two common ways to build Data Store and Concurrent Data Store
applications.  The most common way is as a single, usually
multithreaded, process.  This architecture is simplest because it
requires no monitoring of other threads of control.  When the
application starts, it opens and potentially creates the environment,
and then opens its databases.  From then on, the application can create
new threads of control as it chooses.  All threads of control share the
open Berkeley DB <a href="../../api_c/env_class.html">DB_ENV</a> and <a href="../../api_c/db_class.html">DB</a> handles.  In this model,
databases are rarely opened or closed when more than a single thread of
control is running; that is, they are opened when only a single thread
is running, and closed after all threads but one have exited.  The last
thread of control to exit closes the databases and the environment.</p>
<p>An alternative way to build Berkeley DB applications is as a set of
cooperating processes, which may or may not be multithreaded.  This
architecture is more complicated.</p>
<p>First, this architecture requires that the order in which threads of
control are created and subsequently access the Berkeley DB environment be
controlled because database environment removal must be single-threaded.
The first thread of control to access the environment must remove any
previously existing environment and re-create the environment, and no
other thread should attempt to access the environment until the removal
is complete.  (Note this ordering requirement does not apply to
environment creation without removal.  If multiple threads attempt to
create a Berkeley DB environment, only one will perform the creation and the
others will join the already existing environment.)</p>
<p>Second, this architecture requires that threads of control be monitored.
If any thread of control that owns Berkeley DB resources exits without first
cleanly discarding those resources, removing the database environment
is usually necessary.  Before removing the database environment, all
threads using the Berkeley DB environment must relinquish all of their Berkeley DB
resources (it does not matter if they do so gracefully or because they
are forced to exit).  Then, the database environment can be removed and
and the threads of control continued or restarted.</p>
<p>We have found that the safest way to structure groups of cooperating
processes is to first create a single process (often a shell script)
that removes and re-creates the Berkeley DB environment, verifies, rebuilds
or removes the databases, and then creates the processes or threads that
will actually perform work.  The initial thread has no further
responsibilities other than to monitor the threads of control it has
created, to ensure that none of them unexpectedly exits.  If one exits,
the initial process then forces all of the threads of control using the
Berkeley DB environment to exit, removes the database environment, verifies,
rebuilds or removes the databases, and restarts the working threads of
control.</p>
<p>If it is not practical to have a single parent for the processes sharing
a Berkeley DB environment, each process sharing the environment should log
their connection to and exit from the environment in a way that allows
a monitoring process to detect if a thread of control might have
acquired Berkeley DB resources and never released them.  In this model, an
initial "watcher" process removes and re-creates the Berkeley DB environment,
verifies, rebuilds or removes the databases, and then creates a sentinel
file.  Any other process wanting to use the Berkeley DB environment checks for
the sentinel file; if the sentinel file exists, the other process
registers its process ID with the watcher and joins the database
environment.  When the new process finishes with the environment, it
unregisters its process ID with the watcher.  The watcher periodically
checks to ensure that no process has failed while using the environment.
If a process does fail while using the environment, the watcher removes
the sentinel file, kills all processes currently using the environment,
removes and re-creates the database environment, verifies, rebuilds or
removes the databases, and re-creates the sentinel file.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is important that the monitoring process in either case
be as simple and well-tested as possible because there is no recourse
if it fails.</p>
