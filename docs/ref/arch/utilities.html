<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Architecture</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Supporting utilities</h1>
<p>
There are several stand-alone utilities that support the Berkeley DB environment.
They are as follows:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>db_archive<dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> utility supports database backup, archival and
log file administration.
<p><dt>db_recover<dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility runs after an unexpected Berkeley DB or system
failure to restore the database to a consistent state.
<p><dt>db_checkpoint<dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_checkpoint.html">db_checkpoint</a> utility runs as a daemon process, monitoring
the database log and periodically issuing checkpoints.
<p><dt>db_deadlock<dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock</a> utility runs as a daemon process, periodically
traversing the database lock structures and aborting transactions when
it detects a deadlock.
<p><dt>db_dump<dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> utility writes a copy of the database to a flat-text
file in a portable format.
<p><dt>db_load<dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a>, utility reads the flat-text file produced by
<a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> and loads it into a database file.
<p><dt>db_stat<dd>The <a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility displays statistics for databases and database
environments.
</dl>
<p>
All of the functionality described for these utilities is available as
part of the Berkeley DB API as well.  This means that threaded applications can
simply create a thread to perform this functionality and call the same
underlying Berkeley DB functions as do the utilities.  This often simplifies
the application environment by removing the necessity for multiple
processes to negotiate database and database environment creation.
