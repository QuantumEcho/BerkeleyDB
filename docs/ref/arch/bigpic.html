<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Architecture</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>The big picture</h1>
<p>
So far, we've discussed applications that used only the Access Methods
for fast data storage and retrieval.  Application code that uses
Berkeley DB in this way might appear as follows:
<p>
<p><ul><pre>
switch (errno = dbp->put(dbp, NULL, &key, &data, 0)) {
case 0:
	printf("db: %s: key stored.\n", (char *)key.data);
	break;
default:
	fprintf(stderr, "db: put: %s\n", strerror(errno));
	exit (1);
}
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The underlying Berkeley DB architecture that supports this is:
<p>
<p align=center><img src="smallpic.gif">
<p>
As you can see from this diagram, the application makes calls into the
Access Methods, and the Access Methods use the underlying shared memory
buffer cache to hold recently used file pages in main memory.
<p>
The previous chapters in this Guide have described applications that
use only the Access Methods.  The subsequent chapters will describe how to
build more complex applications that include full database
recoverability.  However, writing recoverable applications requires a
small amount of additional complexity in the application, and quite a bit
of additional complexity in the Berkeley DB library.
<p>
The additional complexity in the application is that calls to the Access
Methods must be wrapped in transaction begin and end calls, i.e., the
application must inform Berkeley DB where to begin and end transactions, and
must be prepared for the possibility that it may not be possible to make
a specific change to the database at any particular time (e.g., that the
transaction can abort).
<p>
A typical example of transaction protected code might appear as follows:
<p>
<p><ul><pre><b>
retry:	if ((errno = txn_begin(txnp, NULL, &tid)) != 0) {
		fprintf(stderr, "db: begin: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		exit (1);
	}
<p>
	switch (errno = dbp->put(dbp, tid, &key, &data, 0)) {
	case EAGAIN:
		(void)txn_abort(tid);
		goto retry;
	case 0:
		printf("db: %s: key stored.\n", (char *)key.data);
		break;
	default:
		fprintf(stderr, "db: put: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		exit (1);
	}
<p>
	if ((errno = txn_commit(tid)) != 0) {
		fprintf(stderr, "db: commit: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		exit (1);
	}
</b>
</pre></ul><p>
<p>
In this example, the same operation is being done as before, however,
it is wrapped in transaction calls.  The transaction is started with
<b>txn_begin</b>, and finished with <b>txn_commit</b>.  If the
operation fails due to a deadlock, then the transaction is aborted using
<b>txn_abort</b>, and the operation is retried from the beginning.
<p>
There are five major subsystems in Berkeley DB:  the Access Methods, the Memory
Buffer Pool, Transactions, Locking and Logging.
<p>
Here is a complete picture of the Berkeley DB package:
<p>
<p align=center><img src="bigpic.gif">
<p>
The application makes calls to the Access Methods and to the Transaction
subsystem.  The Access Methods and Transaction subsystem make calls into
the Buffer Pool, Locking and Logging regions on behalf of the application.
<p>
While each of the underlying subsystems (Lock, Log and Buffer Pool) can
be called separately (e.g., the Buffer Pool subsystem can be used apart
from the rest of Berkeley DB by applications simply wanting shared memory buffer
pool functionality), most applications will either use the Access Methods
only, or the Access Methods wrapped in calls to the Transaction interfaces
if they need database recoverability in the face of application or system
failure.
