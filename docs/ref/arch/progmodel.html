<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Architecture</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Programming model</h1>
<p>
The Berkeley DB library is intended to support an embedded model of applications,
although it is relatively easy to create client-server applications as
well.
<p>
In the client-server model,
a database server is created by writing an application that accepts requests
via some form of IPC and issues calls to the Berkeley DB functions based on those
queries.
In this model,
applications are client programs that attach to the server and issue queries.
The client-server model trades performance for protection,
as it does not require that the applications share a protection domain with
the server,
but IPC/RPC is generally slower than a function call.
In addition,
this model simplifies the creation of network client-server applications.
<p>
In the embedded model,
an application links the Berkeley DB library directly into its address space.
This provides for faster access to database functionality,
but means that the applications sharing log files, lock manager,
transaction manager or memory pool manager have the ability to read,
write, and corrupt each other's data.
<p>
It is the application designer's responsibility to select the appropriate
model for the application.
