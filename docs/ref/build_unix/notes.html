<h1 align=center>Architecture independent notes</h1>
<ol>
<p><li><b>Berkeley DB was configured using --enable-tcl and fails to build.</b>
<p>
The Berkeley DB Tcl interface requires Tcl 8.1 or greater.
<p>
Unfortunately, there is no single location in which to find the Tcl
include file (&lt;tcl.h&gt;) or the Tcl library (libtcl.a) on
different platforms.  Berkeley DB configuration does not do anything special to
locate the Tcl include file, although it does try a few different library
combinations in an attempt to figure out how to load the Tcl library.
<p>
If your Tcl include file is not in one of the standard places checked by
your compiler, then you will have to add CPPFLAGS and/or LIBS and LDFLAGS
to your environment and reconfigure.  For example:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>prompt: env CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/lib" ../dist/configure ...</pre></blockquote>
<p>
See <a href="../../ref/build_unix/flags.html">Changing compile or load options</a>
for more information.
<p>
You may also need to add additional libraries in order to get the Tcl test
suite to load.  Linux systems often require linking "libtcl.a" to
"libtcl#.#.a" or adding "-ldl" to the load line.  Solaris systems often
require adding "-lsocket" and sometimes "-lnsl -ldl" to the load line.
These changes are most simply done by editing the Makefile in your build
directory explicitly.
<p>
Alternatively, you can download Tcl from the
<a href="http://www.scriptics.com">Scriptics Corporation</a> web site
and build your own copy locally.

<p><li><b>I have several versions of Tcl installed. How do I configure
Berkeley DB to use a particular version?</b>
<p>
To compile the Tcl interface with a particular version of Tcl, you may
need to set the environment variables CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS
appropriately for your system before configuring Berkeley DB.  For example:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>prompt: CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" LIBS="-lm -ltcl81 -ldl" \
../dist/configure --enable-dynamic --enable-debug \
--enable-diagnostic --enable-tcl --enable-test</pre></blockquote>
<p>
See <a href="../../ref/build_unix/flags.html">Changing compile or load options</a>
for more information.

<p><li><b>When compiling with gcc, I get unreferenced symbols, e.g.,:
<blockquote><pre>
symbol __muldi3: referenced symbol not found
symbol __cmpdi2: referenced symbol not found</pre></blockquote></b>
<p>
On systems where they're available (e.g., HP-UX, Solaris), Berkeley DB uses
64-bit integral types.  As far as we can tell, some versions of gcc
don't support these types.  The simplest workaround is to reconfigure
Berkeley DB using the --disable-bigfile configuration option, and then rebuild.
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p><li><b>I get unexpected results and database corruption when running
threaded programs.</b>
<p>
<b>I get error messages that mutex (e.g., pthread_mutex_XXX or
mutex_XXX) functions are undefined when linking applications with Berkeley DB.</b>
<p>
On some architectures, the Berkeley DB library uses the POSIX pthreads and UI
threads interfaces for underlying mutex support, e.g., Solaris and HP-UX.
You can specify compilers, compiler flags or link with the appropriate
thread library when loading your application, to resolve the undefined
references:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>cc ... -lpthread ...
cc ... -lthread ...
xlc_r ...
cc ... -mt ...</pre></blockquote>
<p>
See the appropriate architecture-specific Reference Guide pages for more
information.
<p>
On systems where more than one type of mutex is available, it may be
necessary for applications to use the same threads package from which
Berkeley DB draws its mutexes, e.g., if Berkeley DB was built to use the POSIX
pthreads mutex calls for mutex support, the application may need to be
written to use the POSIX pthreads interfaces for its threading model.
While this is only conjecture at this time and we know of no systems that
actually have this requirement, it's not unlikely that some exist.
<p>
Also, Berkeley DB can be configured to use specific underlying interfaces in
some cases, you can use the <a href="../../ref/build_unix/conf.html#--enable-posixmutexes">--enable-posixmutexes</a> and
<a href="../../ref/build_unix/conf.html#--enable-uimutexes">--enable-uimutexes</a> configuration options to specify the POSIX and Unix
International (UI) threads packages.
<p>
Finally, in some cases, it is vitally important to make sure that you load
the correct library.  For example, on Solaris systems, there are POSIX
pthread interfaces in the C library, and so applications can link Berkeley DB
using only C library and not see any undefined symbols.  However, the C
library POSIX pthread mutex support is insufficient for Berkeley DB and Berkeley DB
cannot detect that fact.  Similar errors can arise when applications
(e.g., tclsh) use dlopen to dynamically load Berkeley DB as a library.
<p>
If you are seeing problems in this area after you've confirmed that you're
linking with the correct libraries, there are two other things you can
try.  First, if your platform supports inter-library dependencies, we
recommend that you change the Berkeley DB Makefile to specify the appropriate
threads library when creating the Berkeley DB dynamic library, as an
inter-library dependency.  Second, if your application is using dlopen to
dynamically load Berkeley DB, specify the appropriate thread library on the link
line when you load the application itself.

<p><li><b>Berkeley DB programs or the test suite fail unexpectedly.</b>
<p>
The Berkeley DB architecture does not support placing the shared memory regions
on remote filesystems, e.g., the Network File System (NFS) or the Andrew
File System (AFS).  For this reason, the shared memory regions (normally
located in the database home directory) must reside on a local filesystem.
See <a href="../../ref/env/region.html">Shared Memory Regions</a> for more
information.
<p>
With respect to running the test suite, always check to make sure that
TESTDIR is not on a remote mounted filesystem.

<p><li><b>The <a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> utility fails to build.</b>
<p>
If the errors look something like:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>cc -o db_dump185 db_dump185.o
ld:
Unresolved:
dbopen</pre></blockquote>
<p>
it means that the Berkeley DB 1.85 code was not found in the standard libraries.
To build <a href="../../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> (the utility that converts Berkeley DB 1.85 and
earlier databases to Berkeley DB version 2.X), you must have already built and
installed the Berkeley DB version 1.85 code on the system.  If the Berkeley DB 1.85
code is not part of the standard libraries used for loading, you will need
to edit your Makefile, and change the lines:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>DBE=	db_dump185.o $(CLOBJS)
db_dump185: $(DBE)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(DBE)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
So that the library where the Berkeley DB 1.85 code is found is loaded, e.g.,
<p>
<blockquote><pre>DBE=	db_dump185.o $(CLOBJS)
db_dump185: $(DBE)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(DBE) -ldb185
</pre></blockquote>
