<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Perl</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Using Berkeley DB with Perl</h1>
<p>
The original Perl module for Berkeley DB was <b>DB_File</b>, which was written
to interface to Berkeley DB version 1.85.  The newer Perl module for Berkeley DB is
<b>BerkeleyDB</b>, which was written to interface to version 2.0 and
subsequent releases.  Because Berkeley DB version 2.X has a compatibility API
for version 1.85, you can (and should!) build DB_File using version 2.X
of Berkeley DB, although DB_File will still only support the 1.85 functionality.
<p>
DB_File is distributed with the standard Perl source distribution (look
in the directory "ext/DB_File").  You can find both DB_File and BerkeleyDB
on CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network of mirrored FTP sites.
The master CPAN site is <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/</a>.
<p>
Questions about DB_File and BerkeleyDB are best asked on the Usenet newsgroup
comp.lang.perl.modules.
