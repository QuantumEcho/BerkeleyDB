<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Simple Tutorial</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Key/data pairs</h1>
<p>
Berkeley DB uses key/data pairs to identify elements in the database.
That is, in the general case, whenever you call a Berkeley DB interface,
you present a key to identify the key/data pair on which you intend
to operate.
<p>
For example, you might store the key/data pairs:
<p><ul><pre>
<b>Key:</b>		<b>Data:</b>
fruit		apple
sport		cricket
drink		water
</pre></ul><p>
In each case, the first element of the pair is the key, and the second
is the data.
<p>
To store the first of these key data pairs into the database, you would
call the Berkeley DB interface to store items, with <b>fruit</b> as the key,
and <b>apple</b> as the data.  At some future time, you could then
retrieve the data item associated with <b>fruit</b>, and the Berkeley DB
retrieval interface would return <b>apple</b> to you.
<p>
While there are many variations and some subtleties, <b>all</b> accesses
to data in Berkeley DB come down to key/data pairs.
<p>
Both key and data items are stored in simple structures
(called DBTs) that contain
a reference to memory and a length, counted in bytes.  The key and
data items can be arbitrary binary data of practically any length.
