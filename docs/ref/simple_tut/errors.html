<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Simple Tutorial</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Error returns</h1>
<p>
The Berkeley DB interfaces always return a value of 0 on success.  If the
operation does not succeed for any reason, the return value will be
non-zero.
<p>
If a system error occurred (e.g., we ran out of disk space, or permission
to access a file was denied to us, or an illegal argument was specified
to one of the interfaces), Berkeley DB returns an <b>errno</b> value.  All
of the possible values of <b>errno</b> are greater than 0.
<p>
If the operation didn't fail due to a system error, but wasn't successful
either, Berkeley DB returns a special error value.  For example, if you tried
to retrieve the data item associated with the key <b>fruit</b>, and
there was no such key/data pair in the database, Berkeley DB would return
DB_NOTFOUND, a special error value that means the requested key does not
appear in the database.
