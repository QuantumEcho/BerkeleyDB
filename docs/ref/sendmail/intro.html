<h3>Berkeley DB Reference Guide: Sendmail</h3>
<p>
<h1 align=center>Using Berkeley DB with Sendmail</h1>
<p>
If you are attempting to use Berkeley DB with Sendmail 8.8.X, you must use Berkeley DB
version 1.85.  Berkeley DB versions 2.0 and later are only supported by Sendmail
versions 8.9.X and later.
<p>
We strongly recommend that you not use Berkeley DB version 1.85, as it is no
longer maintained or supported and has known bugs that can cause Sendmail
to fail. Instead, please upgrade to Sendmail version 8.9.X or later and
then use Berkeley DB version 2. For more information on using Berkeley DB with
Sendmail, please review the README and src/README files in the Sendmail
distribution.
<p>
To download Sendmail, or to obtain more information on Sendmail, see the
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org">Sendmail home page</a>, which includes
FAQ pages and problem addresses.
