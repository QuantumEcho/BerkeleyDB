<h1 align=center>Sleepycat Software Berkeley DB Products</h1>
<p>
Sleepycat Software licenses three different products that use the Berkeley DB
technology.
Each product offers a distinct level of database support.
All three products are included in the single Open Source distribution
of Berkeley DB from Sleepycat Software.
Each product adds services, and new interfaces, to the product
that precedes it in the list.
As a result,
developers can download Berkeley DB and build an application that does
only single-user,
read-only database access,
and then add support for more users and transactions later.
<p>
Users who distribute Berkeley DB must ensure that they are licensed to
distribute the Berkeley DB interfaces that they use.  Information on
licensing is available directly from Sleepycat Software, as described
in the <a href="../sleepycat/contact.html">Sleepycat Software Contact
Information</a>.
<h3>Berkeley DB Data Store</h3>
<p>
The Berkeley DB Data Store product is an embeddable, high-performance data store.  It
supports multiple concurrent threads of control to read information
managed by Berkeley DB.
When updates are required, only a single process may be using the
database.
That process may be multi-threaded, but only one thread of control
should be allowed to update the database at any time.
The Berkeley DB Data Store does no locking, and so provides no
guarantees of correct behavior if more than one thread of control is
updating the database at a time.
<p>
The Berkeley DB Data Store is intended for use in
single-user or read-only applications that can guarantee that no more
than one thread of control will ever update the database at any time.
<p>
This product includes <a href="../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> and its methods, and the methods
returned by <a href="../api_c/db_cursor.html">DB-&gt;cursor</a>.
<h3>Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store</h3>
<p>
The Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store product adds multiple-reader, single writer capabilities to
the Berkeley DB Data Store product, supporting applications that need concurrent updates
and do not want to implement their own locking protocols.  The additional
interfaces in the Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store product are <a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a> (using the
<a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_CDB">DB_INIT_CDB</a> flag), and <a href="../api_c/env_close.html">DBENV-&gt;close</a>.
<p>
Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store is intended for applications that require occasional write
access to a database that is largely used for reading.
<h3>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store</h3>
<p>
The Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store product adds full transactional support and recoverability
to the Berkeley DB Data Store product.  This product includes all of the interfaces
in the Berkeley DB library.
<p>
Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store is intended for applications that require industrial-strength
database services, including good performance under high-concurrency
workloads with a mixture of readers and writers, the ability to commit
or roll back multiple changes to the database at a single instant, and
the guarantee that even in the event of a catastrophic system or hardware
failure, any committed database changes will be preserved.
