<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The db_dump utility reads the database file <b>db_file</b> and
writes it to the standard output using a portable flat-text format understood
by the <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility.
The argument <b>db_file</b> must be a file produced using the Berkeley DB
library functions.
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> utility is similar to the db_dump utility
except that it reads databases in the format used by Berkeley DB versions 1.85
and 1.86.
<p>
The options are as follows:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b>-d</b><dd>Dump the specified database in a format helpful for debugging the Berkeley DB
library routines.
<b>
The output format of the <b>-d</b> option is not standard and may change,
without notice, between releases of the Berkeley DB library.</b>
<p><dt><b>-f</b><dd>Write to the specified <b>file</b> instead of to the standard output.
<p><dt><b>-h</b><dd>Specify a home directory for the database.
As Berkeley DB versions before 2.0 did not support the concept of a
<i>database home</i>, <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> does not support
this option.
<p><dt><b>-N</b><dd>Don't acquire shared region locks while searching the database.
This option is intended only for debugging and should not be used under
any other circumstances.
<p><dt><b>-p</b><dd>If characters in either the key or data items are printing characters
(as defined by isprint (3)), use printing characters in <b>file</b> to
represent them.  This option permits users to use standard text editors
and tools to modify the contents of databases.
</dl>
<p>
Note, different systems may have different notions as to what characters
are considered <i>printing characters</i>, and databases dumped in
this manner may be less portable to external systems.
<p>
Dumping and reloading hash databases that use user-defined hash functions
will result in new databases that use the default hash function.
While using the default hash function may not be optimal for the new database,
it will continue to work correctly.
<p>
Dumping and reloading btree databases that use user-defined prefix or
comparison functions will result in new databases that use the default
prefix and comparison functions.
<b>
In this case, it is quite likely that the database will be damaged
beyond repair permitting neither record storage or retrieval.</b>
<p>
The only available workaround for either case is to modify the sources
for the <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility to load the
database using the correct hash, prefix and comparison functions.
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> utility may not be
available on your system as it is not always built when the Berkeley DB
libraries and utilities are installed.
If you are unable to find it, see your system administrator for further
information.
<p>
The db_dump and <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> utility output formats
are documented in the
<a href="../ref/dumpload/format.html">Dump Output Formats</a>
section of the Reference Guide.
<p>
The db_dump utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump185</a> utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
<p>
<h1>Environment Variables</h1>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_HOME<dd>
If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in <a href="../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>.
