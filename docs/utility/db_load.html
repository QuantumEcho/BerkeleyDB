<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility reads from the standard input and loads it into
the database <b>db_file</b>.
The database <b>db_file</b> is created if it does not already exist.
<p>
The input to <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> must be in the output format specified by the
<a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> utility, utilities, or as specified for the <b>-T</b>
below.
<p>
The options are as follows:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b>-c</b><dd>Specify configuration options for the DB_INFO structure provided to
<a href="../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> ignoring any value they may have based on the input.
The command-line format is <b>name=value</b>.
See <a href="db_load.html#Supported Keywords">Supported Keywords</a> for
a list of supported words for the <b>-c</b> option.
<p><dt><b>-f</b><dd>Read from
the specified <b>input</b> file instead of from the standard input.
<p><dt><b>-h</b><dd>Specify a home directory for the database.
<p>
If a home directory is specified, the database environment is opened using
the <a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>, <a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_LOG">DB_INIT_LOG</a>, <a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a>,
<a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a> and <a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_USE_ENVIRON">DB_USE_ENVIRON</a> flags to
<a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>.  (This means that <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> can be used to load
data into databases while they are in use by other processes.) If the
<a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a> call fails, or if no home directory is specified, the
database is still updated, but the environment is ignored, e.g., no
locking is done.
<p><dt><b>-n</b><dd>Do not overwrite existing keys in the database when loading into an
already existing database.
If a key/data pair cannot be loaded into the database for this reason,
a warning message is displayed on the standard error output and the
key/data pair are skipped.
<p><dt><b>-T</b><dd>The <b>-T</b>
option allows non-Berkeley DB applications to easily load text files into databases.
<p>
If the database to be created is of type Btree or Hash, or the keyword
<b>keys</b> is specified as set, the input must be paired lines of text,
where the first line of the pair is the key item, and the second line of
the pair is its corresponding data item.  If the database to be created
is of type Queue or Recno and the keywork <b>keys</b> is not set, the
input must be lines of text, where each line is a new data item for the
database.
<p>
A simple escape mechanism, where newline and backslash (\)
characters are special, is applied to the text input.
Newline characters are interpreted as record separators.
Backslash characters in the text will be interpreted in one of two ways:
if the backslash character precedes another backslash character, the pair
will be interpreted as a literal backslash.
If the backslash character precedes any other character, the two characters
following the backslash will be interpreted as hexadecimal specification of
a single character, e.g., \0a is a newline character in the ASCII
character set.
<p>
For this reason, any backslash or newline characters that naturally
occur in the text input must be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by
<a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a>.
<p>
If the <b>-T</b> option is specified, the underlying access method type
must be specified using the <b>-t</b> option.
<p><dt><b>-t</b><dd>Specify the underlying access method.
If no <b>-t</b> option is specified, the database will be loaded into a
database of the same type as was dumped, e.g., a Hash database will be
created if a Hash database was dumped.
<p>
Btree and Hash databases may be converted from one to the other.  Queue
and Recno databases may be converted from one to the other.  If the
<b>-k</b> option was specified on the call to <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a> then Queue
and Recno databases may be converted to Btree or Hash, with the key being
the integer record number.
</dl>
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility attaches to one or more of the Berkeley DB shared memory
regions.  In order to avoid region corruption, it should always be given
the chance to detach and exit gracefully.  To cause <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> to clean up
after itself and exit, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility exits 0 on success, 1 if one or more key/data
pairs were not loaded into the database because the key already existed,
and &gt;1 if an error occurs.
<p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
The <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility can be used to load text files into databases.
For example, the following command loads the standard UNIX
<i>/etc/passwd</i> file into a database, with the login name as
the key item and the entire password entry as the data item:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
awk -F: '{print $1; print $0}' &lt; /etc/passwd |
    sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' | db_load -T -t hash passwd.db</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Note that backslash characters naturally occurring in the text are escaped
to avoid interpretation as escape characters by <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a>.
<p>
<h1>Environment Variables</h1>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_HOME<dd>If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in <a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>.
</dl>
<p>
<h3><a name="Supported Keywords">Supported Keywords</a></h3>
The following keywords are supported for the <b>-c</b> command-line option
to the <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utility.
See <a href="../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> for further discussion of these keywords and what values
should be specified.
<p>
The parenthetical listing specifies how the value part of the
<b>name=value</b> pair is interpreted.
Items listed as (boolean) expect value to be <b>1</b> (set) or <b>0</b>
(unset).
Items listed as (number) convert value to a number.
Items listed as (string) use the string value without modification.
<dl compact>
<dt>bt_minkey (number)<dd>The minimum number of keys per page.
<dt>db_lorder (number)<dd>The byte order for integers in the stored database metadata.
<dt>db_pagesize (number)<dd>The size of pages used for nodes in the tree, in bytes.
<dt>duplicates (boolean)<dd>The value of the DB_DUP flag.
<dt>h_ffactor (number)<dd>The density within the Hash database.
<dt>h_nelem (number)<dd>The size of the Hash database.
<dt>keys (boolean)<dd>Specify if keys are present for Queue or Recno databases.
<dt>re_len (number)<dd>Specify fixed-length records of the specified length.
<dt>re_pad (string)<dd>Specify the fixed-length record pad character.
<dt>recnum (boolean)<dd>The value of the DB_RECNUM flag.
<dt>renumber (boolean)<dd>The value of the DB_RENUMBER flag.
<dt>subdatabase (string)<dd>The subdatabase to load.
