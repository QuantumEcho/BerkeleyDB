<h3>Description</h3>
<a name="2"><!--meow--></a>
<p>The db_hotbackup utility creates "hot backup" or "hot failover"
snapshots of Berkeley DB database environments.</p>
<p>The db_hotbackup utility performs the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<p><li>If the <b>-c</b> option is specified, checkpoint the source home
database environment, and remove any unnecessary log files.
<p><li>If the target directory for the backup does not exist, it is created
with mode read-write-execute for the owner.
<p>If the target directory for the backup does exist and the <b>-u</b>
option was specified, all log files in the target directory are removed;
if the <b>-u</b> option was not specified, all files in the target
directory are removed.</p>
<p><li>If the <b>-u</b> option was not specified, copy application-specific
files found in the database environment home directory, or any directory
specified using the <b>-d</b> option, into the target directory for
the backup.
<p><li>Copy all log files found in the directory specified by the <b>-l</b>
option (or in the database environment home directory, if no <b>-l</b>
option was specified), into the target directory for the backup.
<p><li>Perform catastrophic recovery on the hot backup.
<p><li>Remove any unnecessary log files from the hot backup.
</ol>
<p>The db_hotbackup utility does not resolve pending transactions that
are in the prepared state.  Applications that use <a href="../api_c/txn_prepare.html">DB_TXN-&gt;prepare</a>
should specify <a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER_FATAL">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</a> when opening the environment,
and run <a href="../api_c/txn_recover.html">DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover</a> to resolve any pending transactions, when
failing over to the hot backup.</p>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<dl compact>
<dt><b>-b</b><dd>Specify the target directory for the backup.
<dt><b>-c</b><dd>Before performing the snapshot, checkpoint the source database environment
and remove any log files that are no longer required in that environment.
<b>To avoid making catastrophic failure impossible, log file removal
must be integrated with log file archival.</b>
<dt><b>-d</b><dd>Specify one or more source directories that contain databases; if none
is specified, the database environment home directory will be searched
for database files.  As database files are copied into a single backup
directory, files named the same, stored in different source directories,
could overwrite each other when copied into the backup directory.
<dt><b>-h</b><dd>Specify the source directory for the backup, that is, the database
environment home directory.
<dt><b>-l</b><dd>Specify a source directory that contains log files; if none is specified,
the database environment home directory will be searched for log files.
<dt><b>-P</b><dd>Specify an environment password.  Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.
<dt><b>-u</b><dd>Update a pre-existing hot backup snapshot by copying in new log files.
If the <b>-u</b> option is specified, no databases will be copied
into the target directory.
<dt><b>-V</b><dd>Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
<dt><b>-v</b><dd>Run in verbose mode, listing operations as they are done.
</dl>
<p>The db_hotbackup utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the
<b>-h</b> option, the environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or
because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a
Berkeley DB environment, db_hotbackup should always be given the chance to
detach from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause db_hotbackup
to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an
interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>
<p>The db_hotbackup utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>
<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<dl compact>
<dt>DB_HOME<dd>If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in <a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a>.
