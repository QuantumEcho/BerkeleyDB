<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The db_checkpoint utility is a daemon process that monitors the
database log and periodically calls <a href="../api_c/DbTxnMgr/checkpoint.html">txn_checkpoint</a> to checkpoint it.
<p>
The options are as follows:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b>-1</b><dd>Checkpoint the log once, and then exit.
<p><dt><b>-h</b><dd>Specify a home directory for the database.
<p><dt><b>-k</b><dd>Checkpoint the database at least as often as every <b>kbytes</b> of log
file are written.
<p><dt><b>-L</b><dd>
Log the execution of the db_checkpoint utility to the specified file in the
following format, where <i>###</i> is the process ID, and the date
is the time the utility starting running.
<p><ul><pre>db_checkpoint: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995</pre></ul><p>
This file will be removed if the db_checkpoint utility exits gracefully.
<p><dt><b>-p</b><dd>Checkpoint the database at least every <b>min</b> minutes.
<p><dt><b>-v</b><dd>Write the time of each checkpoint to the standard output.
</dl>
<p>
At least one of the <b>-1</b>, <b>-k</b> and <b>-p</b> options must
be specified.
<p>
The db_checkpoint utility attaches to one or more of the Berkeley DB shared memory
regions.  In order to avoid region corruption, it should always be given
the chance to detach and exit gracefully.  To cause db_checkpoint to clean up
after itself and exit, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
<p>
The db_checkpoint utility does not attempt to create the Berkeley DB
shared memory regions if they do not already exist.  The application
which creates the region should be started first, and then, once the
region is created, the db_checkpoint utility should be started.
<p>
The <a href="../api_c/DbTxnMgr/checkpoint.html">txn_checkpoint</a> function is the underlying function used by the db_checkpoint utility.
See the db_checkpoint utility source code for an example of using <a href="../api_c/DbTxnMgr/checkpoint.html">txn_checkpoint</a>
in a POSIX 1003.1 environment.
<p>
The db_checkpoint utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
<p>
<h1>Environment Variables</h1>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_HOME<dd>
If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in <a href="../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>.
</dl>
