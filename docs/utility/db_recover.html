<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility must be run after an unexpected application,
Berkeley DB, or system failure to restore the database to a consistent state.
All committed transactions are guaranteed to appear after <a href="../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a>
has run, and all uncommitted transactions will be completely undone.
<p>
The options are as follows:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b>-c</b><dd>Failure was catastrophic.
<p><dt><b>-h</b><dd>Specify a home directory for the database.
<p><dt><b>-v</b><dd>Run in verbose mode.
</dl>
<p>
In the case of catastrophic failure, an archival copy, or <i>snapshot</i>
of all database files must be restored along with all of the log files written
since the database file snapshot was made.
(If disk space is a problem, log files may be referenced by symbolic links).
For further information on creating a database snapshot, see
<a href="../ref/transapp/archival.html">Archival Procedures</a>.
For further information on performing recovery, see
<a href="../ref/transapp/recovery.html">Recovery Procedures</a>.
<p>
If the failure was not catastrophic, the files present on the system at the
time of failure are sufficient to perform recovery.
<p>
If log files are missing, <a href="../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> will identify the missing
log file(s) and fail, in which case the missing log files need to be
restored and recovery performed again.
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility attaches to one or more of the Berkeley DB shared memory
regions.  In order to avoid region corruption, it should always be given
the chance to detach and exit gracefully.  To cause <a href="../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> to clean up
after itself and exit, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
<p>
The <a href="../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.
<p>
<h1>Environment Variables</h1>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_HOME<dd>If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in <a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>.
</dl>
