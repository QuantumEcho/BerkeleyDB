            Isolation guarantees are an important aspect of transactional
            protection.  Transactions
            ensure the data your transaction is working with will not be changed by some other transaction.
            Moreover, the modifications made by a transaction will never be viewable outside of that transaction until
            the changes have been committed.
        </p>
      <p>
            That said, there are different degrees of isolation, and you can choose to relax your isolation
            guarantees to one degree or another depending on your application's requirements. The primary reason why
            you might want to do this is because of performance; the more isolation you ask your transactions to
            provide, the more locking that your application must do. With more locking comes a greater chance of
            blocking, which in turn causes your threads to pause while waiting for a lock. Therefore, by relaxing
            your isolation guarantees, you can <span class="emphasis"><em>potentially</em></span> improve your application's throughput.
            Whether you actually see any improvement depends, of course, on
            the nature of your application's data and transactions.

              <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>READ UNCOMMITTED</td>
                <td>
                    Uncommitted reads means that one transaction will never
                    overwrite another transaction's dirty data.  Dirty data is
                    data that a transaction has modified but not yet committed
                    to the underlying data store. However, uncommitted reads allows a 
                    transaction to see data dirtied by another
                    transaction. In addition, a transaction may read data
                    dirtied by another transaction, but which subsequently
                    is aborted by that other transaction. In this latter
                    case, the reading transaction may be reading data that
                    never really existed in the database.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>READ COMMITTED</td>
                <td>
                    Committed read isolation means that degree 1 is observed, plus data will never change so long as
                    it is addressed by the cursor, but the data may change before the reading cursor is closed.
                    In the case of a transaction, data at the current
                    cursor position will not change, but once the cursor
                    moves, the previous referenced data can change. This
                    means that readers release read locks before the cursor
                    is closed, and therefore, before the transaction
                    completes. Note that this level of isolation causes the
                    cursor to operate in exactly the same way as it does in
                    the absence of a transaction.

                  <p>
                    Committed read is observed, plus the data read by a transaction, T,  
                    will never be dirtied by another transaction before T completes.
                    This means that both read and write locks are not
                    released until the transaction completes.

                        no transactions will see phantoms.  Phantoms are records 
                        returned as a result of a search, but which were not seen by 
                        the same transaction when the identical
                        search criteria was previously used.

                  <p>
                        This is JE's default isolation guarantee.

    By default, JE transactions and transactional cursors offer 
    <span>
        serializable isolation. 
    </span>
    
    
    You can optionally reduce your isolation level by configuring JE to use
    uncommitted read isolation. See 
        <a href="isolation.html#dirtyreads">Reading Uncommitted Data</a> 
     for more information.

        You can also configure JE to use committed read isolation. See
            <a href="isolation.html#readcommitted">Committed Reads</a>
        for more information.

                You can configure your application to read data that has been modified but not yet
                committed by another transaction; that is, dirty data.  When you do this, you 
                may see a performance benefit by allowing your
                application to not have to block waiting for write locks. On the other hand, the data that your
                application is reading may change before the transaction has completed.
            </p>
        <p>
                When used with transactions, uncommitted reads means that one transaction can see data
                modified but not yet committed by another transaction. When
                used with transactional cursors, uncommitted reads means
                that any database reader can see data modified by the
                cursor before the cursor's transaction has committed.
            </p>
        <p>
                Because of this, uncommitted reads allow a transaction to read data
                that may subsequently be aborted by another transaction. In
                this case, the reading transaction will have read data that
                never really existed in the database.
            </p>
        <p>
                To configure your application to read uncommitted data:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Open your database such that it will allow uncommitted reads. You do this by
                            <span>
                                specifying <tt class="literal">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</tt> when you open your database.
                            </span>

                            <span>
                                Specify <tt class="literal">DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED</tt>
                                when you create the transaction, 
                                    <span>
                                        open the cursor, or read a record from the database.
                                    </span>
                                    
                            </span>

        <p>
                For example, the following opens the database such that it supports uncommitted reads, and then creates a
                transaction that causes all reads performed within it to use uncommitted reads. Remember that simply opening
                the database to support uncommitted reads is not enough; you must also declare your read operations to be
                performed using uncommitted reads.

                You can configure your transaction so that the data being
                read by a transactional cursor is consistent so long as it
                is being addressed by the cursor. However, once the cursor is done reading the 
                    
                    <span>
                        record (that is, reading records from the page that it currently has locked),
                    </span>
                the cursor releases its lock on that
                    
                    <span>
                        record or page.
                    </span>
                 This means that the data the cursor has read and released
                 may change before the cursor's transaction has completed.
              </p>
        <p>
                For example,
                suppose you have two transactions, <tt class="literal">Ta</tt> and <tt class="literal">Tb</tt>. Suppose further that
                <tt class="literal">Ta</tt> has a cursor that reads <tt class="literal">record R</tt>, but does not modify it. Normally,
                <tt class="literal">Tb</tt> would then be unable to write <tt class="literal">record R</tt> because
                <tt class="literal">Ta</tt> would be holding a read lock on it. But when you configure your transaction for
                committed reads, <tt class="literal">Tb</tt> <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> modify <tt class="literal">record
                R</tt> before <tt class="literal">Ta</tt> completes, so long as the reading cursor is no longer
                addressing the 
                    
                    <span>
                        record or page.

             </p>
        <p>
                When you configure your application for this level of isolation, you may see better performance
                throughput because there are fewer read locks being held by your transactions. 
                Read committed isolation is most useful when you have a cursor that is reading and/or writing records in
                a single direction, and that does not ever have to go back to re-read those same records. In this case,
                you can allow JE to release read locks as it goes, rather than hold them for the life of the
                transaction.
             </p>
        <p>
                To configure your application to use committed reads, do one of the following:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Create your transaction such that it allows committed reads. You do this by
                            <span>
