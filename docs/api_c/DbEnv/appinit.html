<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The db_appinit function provides a simple way to initialize and configure
the Berkeley DB environment.  It is not necessary that it be called, but it
provides a structure for creating a consistent environment for processes
using one or more of the features of Berkeley DB.
<p>
The <b>db_home</b> and <b>db_config</b> arguments to db_appinit
are described in <a href="../../ref/env/naming.html">Berkeley DB File Naming</a>.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> argument specifies the subsystems that are initialized
and how the environment affects Berkeley DB file naming, among other things.
The <b>flags</b> value is specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or more of the
following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_CREATE">
<p><dt>DB_CREATE<dd>Cause subsystems to create any underlying files, as necessary.
<a name="DB_INIT_CDB">
<p><dt>DB_INIT_CDB<dd>Initialize locking for the Berkeley DB Concurrent Access Methods product.  In this mode, Berkeley DB provides
multiple reader/single writer access.  No other locking should be
specified (e.g., do not set <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>).  Access method calls
are largely unchanged when using the <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html#DB_INIT_CDB">DB_INIT_CDB</a> flag, although
any cursors through which update operations (e.g., <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html">DBcursor->c_put</a>,
<a href="../../api_c/Dbc/del.html">DBcursor->c_del</a>) will be made, must have the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html#DB_RMW">DB_RMW</a> value set in
the flags parameter to the cursor call that creates the cursor.  See
<a href="../../api_c/Db/cursor.html">DB->cursor</a> for more information.
<a name="DB_INIT_LOCK">
<p><dt>DB_INIT_LOCK<dd>Initialize the lock subsystem; see
<a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/open.html">lock_open</a>.
This subsystem should be used when multiple processes or threads are going
to be reading and writing a Berkeley DB database, so that they do not interfere
with each other.  If all threads are accessing the database(s) read-only,
then locking is unnecessary.  When the DB_INIT_LOCK flag is specified, it
is usually necessary to run the deadlock detector, as well.  See
<a href="../../utility/db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock</a> and <a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/detect.html">lock_detect</a> for more information.
<a name="DB_INIT_LOG">
<p><dt>DB_INIT_LOG<dd>Initialize the log subsystem; see
<a href="../../api_c/DbLog/open.html">log_open</a>.
This subsystem is used when recovery from application or system failure
is necessary.]
<a name="DB_INIT_MPOOL">
<p><dt>DB_INIT_MPOOL<dd>Initialize the mpool subsystem; see
<a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a>.
This subsystem is used whenever the application is using the Berkeley DB access
methods for any purpose.]
<a name="DB_INIT_TXN">
<p><dt>DB_INIT_TXN<dd>Initialize the transaction subsystem; see
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/open.html">txn_open</a>.
This subsystem is used when atomicity of multiple operations and recovery
are important.  The DB_INIT_TXN flag implies the DB_INIT_LOG flag.
<a name="DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE">
<p><dt>DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE<dd>Create a private memory pool; see
<a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a>.
Ignored unless DB_INIT_MPOOL is also specified.
<a name="DB_NOMMAP">
<p><dt>DB_NOMMAP<dd>Do not memory map database files within this environment; see
<a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a>.
Ignored unless DB_INIT_MPOOL is also specified.
<a name="DB_RECOVER">
<p><dt>DB_RECOVER<dd>Run normal recovery on this environment before opening it for normal use.
If this flag is set, the DB_CREATE flag must also be set since the regions
will be removed and recreated.
<p>
The db_appinit function returns successfully if DB_RECOVER is
specified and no log files exist, so it is necessary to ensure all
necessary log files are present before running recovery.
For further information, consult <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> and <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a>.
<a name="DB_RECOVER_FATAL">
<p><dt>DB_RECOVER_FATAL<dd>Run catastrophic recovery on this environment before opening it for
normal use.  If this flag is set, the DB_CREATE flag must also be set
since the regions will be removed and recreated.
<p>
The db_appinit function returns successfully if DB_RECOVER_FATAL
is specified and no log files exist, so it is necessary to ensure all
necessary log files are present before running recovery.  For further
information, consult <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> and <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a>.
<a name="DB_THREAD">
<p><dt>DB_THREAD<dd>Ensure that handles returned by the Berkeley DB subsystems are useable by multiple
threads within a single process, i.e., that the system is
<i>free-threaded</i>.
<a name="DB_TXN_NOSYNC">
<p><dt>DB_TXN_NOSYNC<dd>On transaction commit, do not synchronously flush the log; see
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/open.html">txn_open</a>.
Ignored unless DB_INIT_TXN is also specified.
<a name="DB_USE_ENVIRON">
<p><dt>DB_USE_ENVIRON<dd>The Berkeley DB process' environment may be permitted to specify information to
be used when naming files; see <a href="../../ref/env/naming.html">Berkeley DB
File Naming</a>.  As permitting users to specify which files are used can
create security problems, environment information will be used in file
naming for all users only if the DB_USE_ENVIRON flag is set.
<a name="DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT">
<p><dt>DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT<dd>The Berkeley DB process' environment may be permitted to specify information
to be used when naming files; see <a href="../../ref/env/naming.html">Berkeley DB
File Naming</a>.  As permitting users to specify which files are used can
create security problems, if the DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT flag is set,
environment information will be used for file naming only for users with
a user-ID matching that of the superuser (specifically, users for whom
the <b>getuid</b>(2) system call returns the user-ID 0).
</dl>
<p>
The Berkeley DB environment is configured
based on the <b>dbenv</b> argument to db_appinit which is a pointer to
a structure of type DB_ENV.  Applications normally use the same DB_ENV
structure (initialized by db_appinit) as an argument to all of
the subsystems in the Berkeley DB package.
<p>
References to the DB_ENV structure are maintained by Berkeley DB, so it may not
be discarded until the last close function, corresponding to an open
function for which it was an argument, has returned.  To ensure
compatibility with future releases of Berkeley DB, all fields of the DB_ENV
structure that are not explicitly set should be initialized to 0 before
the first time the structure is used.  Do this by declaring the structure
external or static, or by calling one of the C library routines
<b>bzero</b>(3) or <b>memset</b>(3).
<p>
The fields of the DB_ENV structure used by db_appinit are described below.
The <b>dbenv</b> argument may not be NULL.  If any of the fields of
the <b>dbenv</b> structure are set to 0, defaults appropriate for the
system are used where possible.
<p>
The following fields in the DB_ENV structure may be initialized before
calling db_appinit:
<dl compact>
<a name="db_paniccall">
<p><dt>void (*db_paniccall)(DB_ENV *dbenv, int errno);<dd>Errors can occur in the Berkeley DB library where the only solution is to shut
down the application and run recovery.  (For example, if Berkeley DB is unable
to write log records to disk because there is insufficient disk space.)
In these cases, the value DB_RUNRECOVERY is returned by the function.  It
is often simpler, however, to simply shut down the application when such
errors occur instead of attempting to gracefully return error values up
the stack.
<p>
If <b>db_paniccall</b> is non-NULL and such an error occurs, it will
called.  The <b>dbenv</b> argument is a reference to the current
environment, and the <b>errval</b> argument is the system errno value
that was returned when the error occurred.
<a name="db_errcall">
<p><dt>void (*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char *buffer);<dd>When an error occurs in the Berkeley DB library, an <b>errno</b> value is
returned by the function.  In some cases, however, the <b>errno</b>
value may be insufficient to completely describe the cause of the error
especially during initial application debugging.
<p>
If <b>db_errcall</b> is non-NULL, it may be called with additional error
information.  The <b>db_errpfx</b> argument is the current environment's
<b>db_errpfx</b> field.  The <b>buffer</b> argument contains a
nul-terminated string with the additional information.
<p>
This error logging facility does not slow performance or significantly
increase application size, and may be run during normal operation as
well as during debugging.
<a name="db_errfile">
except that the error message is written to the OutputStream
represented by <b>error_stream</b>.
allowing errors to be
redirected to a C++ error stream.  It is unwise to use both error_stream
with nonzero values of either errcall or errfile.
<p><dt>FILE *db_errfile;<dd>The <b>db_errfile</b> field behaves similarly to the <b>db_errcall</b>
field
<a name="db_errpfx">
<p><dt>const char *db_errpfx;<dd>A prefix to prepend to error messages.  Because Berkeley DB does not copy the
memory referenced by the <b>db_errpfx</b> field, applications may modify
the error message prefix at any time.
<a name="db_verbose">
<p><dt>int db_verbose;<dd>Include informational and debugging messages as well as error messages
in the <b>db_errcall</b> and <b>db_errfile</b> output.
</dl>
<p>
Each of the open functions that db_appinit may call
(<a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/open.html">lock_open</a>, <a href="../../api_c/DbLog/open.html">log_open</a>, <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a> and
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/open.html">txn_open</a>), is called as follows, where the DB_CREATE
flag is optional:
<p><ul><pre>XXX_open(NULL, DB_CREATE,
    S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP, dbenv);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
This call will cause each subsystem to construct pathnames as described
in <a href="../../ref/env/naming.html">Berkeley DB File Naming</a>.  The subsystem
has permission to read and write underlying files as necessary, and
optionally to create files.  (All created files will be created readable
and writeable by the owner and the group.  The group ownership of created
files is based on the system and directory defaults, and is not further
specified by Berkeley DB.)
<p>
In addition, the <b>dbenv</b> argument is passed to the open functions
of any subsystems initialized by db_appinit.  For this reason the
fields of the DB_ENV structure relevant to the subsystems being
initialized must themselves be initialized before db_appinit is
called.  See the appropriate subsystem documentation for a list of these
fields and their uses.
<p>
The return value from each of these calls is placed in the appropriate
field of the DB_ENV structure:
<dl compact>
<a name="lk_info">
<dt>DB_LOCKTAB *lk_info;<dd>The return value of the <a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/open.html">lock_open</a> call.
<a name="lg_info">
<dt>DB_LOG *lg_info;<dd>The return value of the <a href="../../api_c/DbLog/open.html">log_open</a> call.
<a name="mp_info">
<dt>DB_MPOOL *mp_info;<dd>The return value of the <a href="../../api_c/DbMpool/open.html">memp_open</a> call.
<a name="tx_info">
<dt>DB_TXNMGR *tx_info;<dd>The return value of the <a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/open.html">txn_open</a> call.
</dl>
<p>
In general, these fields are not directly used by applications; subsystems
of Berkeley DB that use these fields simply reference them using the DB_ENV
structure passed to the subsystem.
<p>
For example,
an application using the Berkeley DB hash access method functions to access a
database will first call <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> passing it the DB_ENV
argument initialized by a call to db_appinit.  Then, all future
calls to the hash access method functions for that database will
automatically use the underlying shared memory buffer pool that was
specified by the <b>mp_info</b> field of that DB_ENV structure.
<p>
The single exception to this rule is the <b>tx_info</b> field, which
applications must explicitly specify to the <a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/begin.html">txn_begin</a>,
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/checkpoint.html">txn_checkpoint</a> and <a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/close.html">txn_close</a> functions.
<p>
The <b>db_prefix</b> field of DB_ENV allows the user to configure
the error message prefix, and may be changed at any time, including after
the call to db_appinit.
<p>
Otherwise, once the Berkeley DB environment has been initialized by a call to
db_appinit, no fields should be modified.
<p>
<h1>Architecture Notes</h1>
Due to the constraints of the PA-RISC memory architecture, HP-UX does not
allow a process to map a file into its address space multiple times.
For this reason, each Berkeley DB environment may be opened only once by a
process on HP-UX, i.e., calls to db_appinit will fail if the
specified Berkeley DB environment has been opened and not subsequently closed.
<p>
On Windows/95, files that are opened by multiple processes do not share
data correctly.  To cause Berkeley DB to use the paging file to share memory
among processes, use the <a href="../../api_c/internal/db_value_set.html#DB_REGION_NAME">DB_REGION_NAME</a> flag of the
<a href="../../api_c/internal/db_value_set.html">db_value_set</a> function.  Obviously, you do not need to do this if
only a single process will be accessing database files.
<p>
The db_appinit
function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the db_appinit function may fail and return
DB_RUNRECOVERY, at which point all subsequent database calls will also
return DB_RUNRECOVERY.
<p>
The db_appinit
function may fail and return <b>errno</b>
for any of the errors specified for the following Berkeley DB and C library
functions:
<a href="../../api_c/Db/close.html">DB->close</a>,
abort(3),
ctime(3),

<p>
In addition, the db_appinit
function may fail and return <b>errno</b>
for the following conditions:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>
The DB_THREAD flag was specified and spinlocks are not implemented for
this architecture.
