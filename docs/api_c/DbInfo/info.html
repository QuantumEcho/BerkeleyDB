<h1>Berkeley DB Access Method Specific Initialization</h1>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<tt>
<p>
Access method specific information is provided to <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>
using the DB_INFO data argument.
The DB_INFO structure has a large number of fields, most specific to a
single access method, although a few are shared.  The fields that are
common to all access methods are listed here; those specific to an
individual access method are described below.  No reference to the DB_INFO
structure is maintained by Berkeley DB, so it is possible to discard it as soon
as the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call returns.
<p>
In order to ensure compatibility with future releases of Berkeley DB, all fields
of the DB_INFO structure should be initialized to 0 before the structure
is used.
Do this by declaring the structure external or static, or by calling the
C library function <b>bzero</b>(3) or <b>memset</b>(3).
<p>
If possible, defaults appropriate for the system are used for the DB_INFO
fields if <b>dbinfo</b> is NULL or any fields of the DB_INFO structure
are set to 0.
The following DB_INFO fields may be initialized before calling
<a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>:
<dl compact>
<a name="db_cachesize">
<p><dt>size_t db_cachesize;<dd>A suggested maximum size of the memory pool cache, in bytes.
If <b>db_cachesize</b> is 0, an appropriate default is used.
It is an error to specify both the <b>mp_info</b> field and a
non-zero <b>db_cachesize</b>.
<p>
<b>Note, the minimum number of pages in the cache should be no less
than 10, and the access methods will fail if an insufficiently large
cache is specified.</b>
In addition, for applications that exhibit strong locality in their
data access patterns, increasing the size of the cache can significantly
improve application performance.
<p>
For information on tuning the Berkeley DB cache size, see
<a href="../../ref/am/cachesize.html">Selecting a cache size</a>.
<a name="db_lorder">
<p><dt>int db_lorder;<dd>The byte order for integers in the stored database metadata.
The number should represent the order as an integer, for example,
big endian order is the number 4,321, and little endian order is
the number 1,234.
If <b>db_lorder</b> is 0, the host order of the machine where the Berkeley DB
library was compiled is used.
<p>
The value of <b>db_lorder</b> is ignored except when databases are being
created.
If a database already exists, the byte order it uses is determined when
the file is read.
<p>
<b>The access methods provide no guarantees about the byte ordering of the
application data stored in the database,
and applications are responsible for maintaining any necessary ordering.</b>
<a name="db_pagesize">
<p><dt>size_t db_pagesize;<dd>The size of the pages used to hold items in the database, in bytes.
The minimum page size is 512 bytes and the maximum page size is 64K bytes.
If <b>db_pagesize</b> is 0, a page size is selected based on the underlying
filesystem I/O block size.
The selected size has a lower limit of 512 bytes and an upper limit
of 16K bytes.
<p>
For information on tuning the Berkeley DB page size, see
<a href="../../ref/am/pagesize.html">Selecting a page size</a>.
<a name="dup_compare">
<p><dt>int (*dup_compare)(const DBT *, const DBT *);<dd>Specify a duplicate comparison function.  It must return an integer less
than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first key argument is
considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the
second key argument. The same comparison function must be used on a given
tree every time it is opened.  See <a href="../../api_c/DbInfo/info.html#DB_DUPSORT">DB_DUPSORT</a> for more
information.
<a name="db_malloc">
<p><dt>void *(*db_malloc)(size_t);<dd>The flag <a href="../../api_c/Dbt/dbt.html#DB_DBT_MALLOC">DB_DBT_MALLOC</a>, when specified in the DBT structure,
will cause the Berkeley DB library to allocate memory which then becomes the
responsibility of the calling application.
<p>
On systems where there may be multiple library versions of malloc (notably
Windows NT), specifying the <a href="../../api_c/Dbt/dbt.html#DB_DBT_MALLOC">DB_DBT_MALLOC</a> flag will fail because
the Berkeley DB library will allocate memory from a different heap than the
application will use to free it.
To avoid this problem, the <b>db_malloc</b> field should be set to
point to the application's allocation routine.
If <b>db_malloc</b> is non-NULL, it will be used to allocate the memory
returned when the <a href="../../api_c/Dbt/dbt.html#DB_DBT_MALLOC">DB_DBT_MALLOC</a> flag is set.
The <b>db_malloc</b> function must match the calling conventions of the
<b>malloc</b>(3) library routine.
</dl>
<h1>Btree</h1>
<p>
The following additional fields and flags may be initialized in the DB_INFO
structure before calling <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>, when using the Btree access method:
<dl compact>
<a name="bt_compare">
<p><dt>int (*bt_compare)(const DBT *, const DBT *);<dd>The <b>bt_compare</b> function is the key comparison function.
It must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the
first key argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to,
or greater than the second key argument.
The same comparison function must be used on a given tree every time it
is opened.
<p>
The <b>data</b> and <b>size</b> fields of the DBT are the only fields that
may be used for the purposes of this comparison.
<p>
If <b>bt_compare</b> is NULL, the keys are compared lexically, with
shorter keys collating before longer keys.
<a name="bt_minkey">
<p><dt>u_int32_t bt_minkey;<dd>The minimum number of keys that will be stored on any single page.
This value is used to determine which keys will be stored on overflow
pages, i.e. if a key or data item is larger than the pagesize divided
by the <b>bt_minkey</b> value, it will be stored on overflow pages
instead of in the page itself.
The <b>bt_minkey</b> value specified must be at least 2; if
<b>bt_minkey</b> is 0, a value of 2 is used.
<a name="bt_prefix">
<p><dt>size_t (*bt_prefix)(const DBT *, const DBT *);<dd>The <b>bt_prefix</b> function is the prefix comparison function.
If specified, this function must return the number of bytes of the second key
argument that are necessary to determine that it is greater than the first
key argument.
If the keys are equal, the key length should be returned.
<p>
The <b>data</b> and <b>size</b> fields of the DBT are the only fields
that may be used for the purposes of this comparison.
<p>
This function is used to compress the keys stored on the btree internal
pages.  The usefulness of this is data dependent, but in some data sets
can produce significantly reduced tree sizes and search times.
<p>
If <b>bt_prefix</b> is NULL, and no key comparison function
is specified, a default lexical comparison function is used for
prefix compression.  If <b>bt_prefix</b> is NULL and a key
comparison function is specified, no prefix compression is done.
It is an error to specify a prefix compression function without
also specifying a key comparison function.
<a name="bt_flags">
<p><dt>u_int32_t flags;<dd>The following additional flags may be specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or
more of the following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_DUP">
<p><dt>DB_DUP<dd>Permit duplicate data items in the tree, i.e. insertion when the key of
the key/data pair being inserted already exists in the tree will be
successful.  The ordering of duplicates in the tree is determined by the
order of insertion, unless the ordering is otherwise specified by use of
a cursor or a duplicate comparison function.
It is an error to specify both DB_DUP and DB_RECNUM.
<a name="DB_DUPSORT">
<p><dt>DB_DUPSORT<dd>Sort duplicates within a set of data items.  If the application does not
specify a comparison function using the dup_compare element of
the DB_INFO structure, a default, lexical comparison will be used.
<p>
Specifying that duplicates are to be sorted changes the behavior of the
<a href="../../api_c/Db/put.html">DB->put</a> operation as well as the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html">DBcursor->c_put</a> operation when
the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYFIRST">DB_KEYFIRST</a>, <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYLAST">DB_KEYLAST</a> and <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html#DB_CURRENT">DB_CURRENT</a>
flags are specified.
<a name="DB_RECNUM">
<p><dt>DB_RECNUM<dd>Support retrieval from btrees using record numbers.
For more information, see the DB_SET_RECNO flag to the <a href="../../api_c/Db/get.html">DB->get</a>
function and the cursor <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html">DBcursor->c_get</a> function.
<p>
Logical record numbers in btrees are mutable in the face of record
insertion or deletion.
See the DB_RENUMBER flag in the RECNO section below for further discussion.
<p>
Maintaining record counts within a btree introduces a serious point of
contention, namely the page locations where the record counts are stored.
In addition, the entire tree must be locked during both insertions and
deletions, effectively single-threading the tree for those operations.
Specifying DB_RECNUM can result in serious performance degradation for
some applications and data sets.
It is an error to specify both DB_DUP and DB_RECNUM.
</dl>
</dl>
<h1>Hash</h1>
<p>
The following additional fields and flags may be initialized in the DB_INFO
structure before calling <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>, when using the hash access method:
<dl compact>
<a name="h_ffactor">
<p><dt>u_int32_t h_ffactor;<dd>The desired density within the hash table.
It is an approximation of the number of keys allowed to accumulate in any
one bucket, determining when the hash table grows or shrinks.
The default value is 0, indicating that the fill factor will be selected
dynamically as pages are filled.
<a name="h_hash">
<p><dt>u_int32_t (*h_hash)(const void *, u_int32_t);<dd>The <b>h_hash</b> field is a user defined hash function;
if <b>h_hash</b> is NULL, a default hash function is used.
Since no hash function performs equally well on all possible data,
the user may find that the built-in hash function performs poorly with
a particular data set.
User specified hash functions must take a pointer to a byte string and
a length as arguments and return a u_int32_t value.
<p>
If a hash function is specified, <b>hash_open</b> will attempt to determine
if the hash function specified is the same as the one with which the database
was created, and will fail if it detects that it is not.
<a name="h_nelem">
<p><dt>u_int32_t h_nelem;<dd>An estimate of the final size of the hash table.
If not set or set too low,
hash tables will expand gracefully as keys are entered,
although a slight performance degradation may be noticed.
The default value is 1.
<a name="h_flags">
<p><dt>u_int32_t flags;<dd>The following additional flags may be specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or
more of the following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_DUP">
<p><dt>DB_DUP<dd>Permit duplicate data items in the tree, i.e. insertion when the key of
the key/data pair being inserted already exists in the tree will be
successful.  The ordering of duplicates in the tree is determined by the
order of insertion, unless the ordering is otherwise specified by use of
a cursor or a duplicate comparison function.
<a name="DB_DUPSORT">
<p><dt>DB_DUPSORT<dd>Sort duplicates within a set of data items.  If the application does not
specify a comparison function using the dup_compare element of
the DB_INFO structure, a default, lexical comparison will be used.
<p>
Specifying that duplicates are to be sorted changes the behavior of the
<a href="../../api_c/Db/put.html">DB->put</a> operation as well as the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html">DBcursor->c_put</a> operation when
the <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYFIRST">DB_KEYFIRST</a>, <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYLAST">DB_KEYLAST</a> and <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html#DB_CURRENT">DB_CURRENT</a>
flags are specified.
</dl>
</dl>
<h1>Recno</h1>
<p>
The following additional fields and flags may be initialized in the DB_INFO
structure before calling <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>, when using the recno access method:
<dl compact>
<a name="re_delim">
<p><dt>int re_delim;<dd>For variable length records, if the <b>re_source</b> file is specified
and the DB_DELIMITER flag is set, the delimiting byte used to mark the end
of a record in the source file.
If the <b>re_source</b> file is specified and the DB_DELIMITER flag is not
set, <newline> characters (i.e. \n, 0x0a) are interpreted as
end-of-record markers.
<a name="re_len">
<p><dt>u_int32_t re_len;<dd>The length of a fixed-length record.
<a name="re_pad">
<p><dt>int re_pad;<dd>For fixed length records, if the DB_PAD flag is set, the pad character for
short records.  If the DB_PAD flag is not set, <space> characters (i.e.,
0x20) are used for padding.
<a name="re_source">
<p><dt>char *re_source;<dd>The purpose of the <b>re_source</b> field is to provide fast access and
modification to databases that are normally stored as flat text files.
<p>
If the <b>re_source</b> field is non-NULL, it specifies an underlying flat
text database file that is read to initialize a transient record number index.
In the case of variable length records, the records are separated by the byte
value <b>re_delim</b>.
For example, standard UNIX byte stream files can be interpreted as a sequence
of variable length records separated by <newline> characters.
<p>
In addition, when cached data would normally be written back to the underlying
database file (e.g., the <b>close</b>(2) or <b>sync</b> functions are
called), the in-memory copy of the database will be written back to the
<b>re_source</b> file.
<p>
By default, the backing source file is read lazily, i.e., records are not read
from the file until they are requested by the application.
<b>If multiple processes (not threads) are accessing a recno database
concurrently and either inserting or deleting records,
the backing source file must be read in its entirety before more than
a single process accesses the database,
and only that process should specify the backing source file as part
of the <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> call.</b>
See the DB_SNAPSHOT flag below for more information.
<p>
<b>Reading and writing the backing source file specified by re_source
cannot be transactionally protected because it involves filesystem
operations that are not part of the Berkeley DB transaction methodology.</b>
For this reason, if a temporary database is used to hold the records,
i.e., a NULL was specified as the <b>file</b> argument to
<a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>, it is possible to lose the contents of the
<b>re_source</b> file, e.g., if the system crashes at the right instant.
If a file is used to hold the database, i.e., a file name was specified
as the <b>file</b> argument to <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>, normal database recovery
on that file can be used to prevent information loss, although it is still
possible that the contents of <b>re_source</b> will be lost if the system
crashes.
<p>
The <b>re_source</b> file must already exist (but may be zero-length) when
<a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> is called.
<p>
For all of the above reasons, the <b>re_source</b> field is generally used
to specify databases that are read-only for Berkeley DB applications, and that are
either generated on the fly by software tools, or modified using a different
mechanism, e.g., a text editor.
<a name="re_flags">
<p><dt>u_int32_t flags;<dd>The following additional flags may be specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or
more of the following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_DELIMITER">
<p><dt>DB_DELIMITER<dd>The <b>re_delim</b> field is set.
<a name="DB_FIXEDLEN">
<p><dt>DB_FIXEDLEN<dd>The records are fixed-length, not byte delimited.
The structure element <b>re_len</b> specifies the length of the record,
and the structure element <b>re_pad</b> is used as the pad character.
<p>
Any records added to the database that are less than <b>re_len</b>
bytes long are automatically padded.
Any attempt to insert records into the database that are greater than
<b>re_len</b> bytes long will cause the call to fail immediately and
return an error.
<a name="DB_PAD">
<p><dt>DB_PAD<dd>The <b>re_pad</b> field is set.
<a name="DB_RENUMBER">
<p><dt>DB_RENUMBER<dd>Specifying the DB_RENUMBER flag causes the logical record numbers to be
mutable, and change as records are added to and deleted from the database.
For example, the deletion of record number 4 causes records numbered 5
and greater to be renumbered downward by 1.
If a cursor was positioned to record number 4 before the deletion,
it will reference the new record number 4, if any such record exists,
after the deletion.
If a cursor was positioned after record number 4 before the deletion,
it will be shifted downward 1 logical record,
continuing to reference the same record as it did before.
<p>
Using the <a href="../../api_c/Db/put.html">DB->put</a> or <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html">DBcursor->c_put</a> interfaces to create
new records will cause the creation of multiple records if the record number
is more than one greater than the largest record currently in the database.
For example, creating record 28, when record 25 was previously the last record
in the database, will create records 26 and 27 as well as 28.
Attempts to retrieve records that were created in this manner will result in
an error return of DB_KEYEMPTY.
<p>
If a created record is not at the end of the database,
all records following the new record will be automatically renumbered
upward by 1.
For example,
the creation of a new record numbered 8 causes records numbered 8 and
greater to be renumbered upward by 1.
If a cursor was positioned to record number 8 or greater before the insertion,
it will be shifted upward 1 logical record,
continuing to reference the same record as it did before.
<p>
For these reasons, concurrent access to a recno database with the DB_RENUMBER
flag specified may be largely meaningless, although it is supported.
<a name="DB_SNAPSHOT">
<p><dt>DB_SNAPSHOT<dd>This flag specifies that any specified <b>re_source</b> file be read in
its entirety when <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a> is called.
If this flag is not specified, the <b>re_source</b> file may be read lazily.
