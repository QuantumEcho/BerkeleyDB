<h1>Description</h1>
The txn_open
function copies a pointer, to the "transaction region" identified by the <i>directory</i>
<b>dir</b>, into the memory location referenced by <b>regionp</b>.
<p>
The
<b>dir</b> pathname argument is interpreted as described in
<a href="../../ref/env/naming.html">Berkeley DB File Naming</a>.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> and <b>mode</b> arguments specify how files will be opened
and/or created if they do not already exist.
The flags value is specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or more of the
following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_CREATE">
<p><dt>DB_CREATE<dd>Create any underlying files, as necessary.  If the files do not already
exist and the DB_CREATE flag is not specified, the call will fail.
<a name="DB_THREAD">
<p><dt>DB_THREAD<dd>Cause the m4_reg(DbTxnMgr) handle returned by txn_open to be useable
by multiple threads within a single address space, i.e., to be
<i>free-threaded</i>.
<a name="DB_TXN_NOSYNC">
<p><dt>DB_TXN_NOSYNC<dd>On transaction commit, do not synchronously flush the log.
This means that transactions exhibit the ACI (atomicity, consistency and
isolation) properties, but not D (durability), i.e., database integrity
will be maintained but it is possible that some number of the most
recently committed transactions may be undone during recovery instead of
being redone.
<p>
The number of transactions that are potentially at risk is governed by
how often the log is checkpointed (see <a href="../../utility/db_checkpoint.html">db_checkpoint</a> for more
information) and how many log updates can fit on a single log page.
</dl>
<p>
All files created by the transaction subsystem are created with mode <b>mode</b> (as described
in <b>chmod</b>(2)) and modified by the process' umask value at the time
of creation (see <b>umask</b>(2)))).
The group ownership of created files is based on the system and directory
defaults, and is not further specified by Berkeley DB.
<p>
The transaction subsystem is configured
based on the <b>dbenv</b> argument to txn_open which is a pointer to
a structure of type DB_ENV.  Applications normally use the same DB_ENV
structure (initialized by <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>) as an argument to all of
the subsystems in the Berkeley DB package.
<p>
References to the DB_ENV structure are maintained by Berkeley DB, so it may not
be discarded until the last close function, corresponding to an open
function for which it was an argument, has returned.  To ensure
compatibility with future releases of Berkeley DB, all fields of the DB_ENV
structure that are not explicitly set should be initialized to 0 before
the first time the structure is used.  Do this by declaring the structure
external or static, or by calling one of the C library routines
<b>bzero</b>(3) or <b>memset</b>(3).
<p>
The fields of the DB_ENV structure used by txn_open are described below.
If <b>dbenv</b> is NULL or any of its fields are set to 0, defaults
appropriate for the system are used where possible.
<p>
The following fields in the DB_ENV structure may be initialized before
calling txn_open:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>void *(*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char *buffer);<dd>
<dt>FILE *db_errfile;<dd>
<dt>const char *db_errpfx;<dd>
<dt>int db_verbose;<dd>The error fields of the DB_ENV behave as described for <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a>.
<a name="lg_info">
<p><dt>DB_LOG *lg_info;<dd>The logging region that is being used for this transaction environment.
The <b>lg_info</b> field contains a return value from the <a href="../../api_c/DbLog/open.html">log_open</a> function.
<b>Logging is required for transaction environments,
and it is an error to not specify a logging region.</b>
<a name="lk_info">
<p><dt>DB_LOCKTAB *lk_info;<dd>The locking region that is being used for this transaction environment.
The <b>lk_info</b> field contains a return value from the <a href="../../api_c/DbLockTab/open.html">lock_open</a> function.
If <b>lk_info</b> is NULL, no locking is done in this transaction
environment.
<a name="tx_max">
<p><dt>u_int32_t tx_max;<dd>The maximum number of simultaneous transactions that are supported.
This bounds the size of backing files and is used to derive limits for
the size of the lock region and logfiles.
When there are more than <b>tx_max</b> concurrent transactions, calls to
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/begin.html">txn_begin</a> may cause backing files to grow.
If <b>tx_max</b> is 0, a default value is used.
<a name="tx_recover">
<p><dt>
int (*tx_recover)(DB_LOG *logp, DBT *log_rec, DB_LSN *lsnp, int redo, void *info);<dd>A function that is called by <a href="../../api_c/DbTxn/abort.html">txn_abort</a> during transaction abort.
This function takes five arguments:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>logp<dd>A pointer to the transaction log (DB_LOG *).
<p><dt>log_rec<dd>A log record.
<p><dt>lsnp<dd>A pointer to a log sequence number (DB_LSN *).
<p><dt>redo<dd>An integer value that is set to one of the following values:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL<dd>The log is being read backward to determine which transactions have been
committed and which transactions were not (and should therefore be aborted
during recovery).
<p><dt>DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL<dd>The log is being played forward, any transaction ids encountered that
have not been entered into the list referenced by
<b>info</b> should be ignored.
<p><dt>DB_TXN_OPENFILES<dd>The log is being read to open all the files required to perform recovery.
<p><dt>DB_TXN_REDO<dd>Redo the operation described by the log record.
<p><dt>DB_TXN_UNDO<dd>Undo the operation described by the log record.
</dl>
<p><dt>info<dd>An opaque pointer used to reference the list of transaction IDs encountered
during recovery.
</dl>
<p>
If <b>tx_recover</b> is NULL, the default is that only Berkeley DB access method
operations are transaction protected, and the default recover function
will be used.
</dl>
<p>
The txn_open
function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<h1>Environment Variables</h1>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_HOME<dd>If the <b>dbenv</b> argument to txn_open was initialized using
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a> the environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b> may
be used as the path of the database home for the interpretation of
the <b>dir</b> argument.
</dl>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>TMPDIR<dd>If the <b>dbenv</b> argument to txn_open was NULL or not initialized
using <a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/appinit.html">db_appinit</a> the environment variable <b>TMPDIR</b> may
be used as the directory in which to create the transaction region, as described in
txn_open.
</dl>
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the txn_open function may fail and return
DB_RUNRECOVERY, at which point all subsequent database calls will also
return DB_RUNRECOVERY.
<p>
The txn_open
function may fail and return <b>errno</b>
for any of the errors specified for the following Berkeley DB and C library
functions:
abort(3),
close(3),
<a href="../../api_c/DbEnv/version.html">db_version</a>,
fcntl(3),
fflush(3),
fprintf(3),
free(3),
fstat(3),
fsync(3),
getenv(3),
getpid(3),
getuid(3),
isdigit(3),
lseek(3),
malloc(3),
memcpy(3),
memset(3),
mmap(3),
munmap(3),
open(3),
pstat_getdynamic(3),
read(3),
shmat(3),
shmctl(3),
shmdt(3),
sigfillset(3),
sigprocmask(3),
stat(3),
strerror(3),
strlen(3),
sysconf(3),
time(3),
<a href="../../api_c/DbTxnMgr/unlink.html">txn_unlink</a>,
unlink(3),
vfprintf(3),
vsnprintf(3),
and
write(3).
<p>
In addition, the txn_open
function may fail and return <b>errno</b>
for the following conditions:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EAGAIN<dd>The shared memory region was locked and (repeatedly) unavailable.
</dl>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>
The DB_THREAD flag was specified and spinlocks are not implemented for
this architecture.
<p>
The <b>dbenv</b> parameter was NULL.
</dl>
