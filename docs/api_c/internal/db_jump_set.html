<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The db_jump_set function enables applications to replace underlying
Berkeley DB library functionality by replacing entries in a function call
jump table.
The <b>which</b> argument specifies the entry to be replaced by the
argument <b>func</b>.
<p>
<b>No type checking is done of the <b>func</b> argument, and specifying an
invalid replacement routine is likely to cause unpredictable results.</b>
<p>
The following values of <b>which</b> are supported:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_FUNC_CLOSE">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_CLOSE<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX) <b>close</b> function
with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_DIRFREE">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_DIRFREE<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to return any memory allocated as part
of the routine which reads through a directory and creates a list of files
that that the directory contains (see DB_FUNC_DIRLIST).
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>int dirfree(char **namesp, int cnt);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>namesp</b> and <b>cnt</b> arguments are the same values as were
returned by the DB_FUNC_DIRLIST function.
<p>
The <b>dirfree</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_DIRLIST">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_DIRLIST<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to read through a directory and create
a list of files that that the directory contains.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>int dirlist(const char *dir, char ***namesp, int *cntp);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>dir</b> argument is the name of the directory to be searched.
The function must return a pointer to an array of nul-terminated file
names in the memory location referenced by the argument <b>namesp</b>,
and a count of the number of elements in the array in the memory location
referenced by <b>cntp</b>.
<p>
The <b>dirlist</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_EXISTS">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_EXISTS<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to determine if a file exists,
and optionally, if it is a file of type directory.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>int exists(const char *path, int *isdirp);</pre></ul><p>
The <b>path</b> argument is the pathname of the file to be checked.
<p>
If the <b>isdirp</b> argument is non-NULL, it must be set to non-0 if
<b>path</b> is a directory, and 0 if <b>path</b> is not a directory.
<p>
The <b>exists</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_FREE">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_FREE<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the ANSI C X3.159-1989 (ANSI C) standard
<b>free</b> function with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard
interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_FSYNC">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_FSYNC<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX) <b>fsync</b> function
with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_IOINFO">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_IOINFO<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to determine the size and I/O
characteristics of a file.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>
int ioinfo(const char *path, int fd,
    u_int32_t *mbytesp, u_int32_t *bytesp, u_int32_t *iosizep);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>path</b> argument is the pathname of the file to be checked, and the
<b>fd</b> argument is an open file descriptor on the file.
<p>
If the <b>mbytesp</b> and <b>bytesp</b> arguments are non-NULL, the
<b>ioinfo</b> function must return in them the size of the file: the
number of megabytes in the file into the memory location referenced by the
<b>mbytesp</b> argument, and the number of bytes over and above that number
of megabytes into the memory location referenced by the <b>bytesp</b>
argument.
<p>
In addition, if the <b>iosizep</b> argument is non-NULL, the <b>ioinfo</b>
function must return the optimum granularity for I/O operations to the file
in the memory location referenced by it.
<p>
The <b>ioinfo</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_MALLOC">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_MALLOC<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the ANSI C X3.159-1989 (ANSI C) standard
<b>malloc</b> function with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard
interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_MAP">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_MAP<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to map a file into memory and to
create shared memory regions (which may or may not be backed by files).
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>
int map(char *path, int fd, size_t len,
    int is_region, int is_anonymous, int is_rdonly,
    void **addr);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>path</b> argument is the name of a file.
The <b>fd</b> argument is an open file descriptor on that file.
<p>
The <b>is_region</b> argument will be zero if the intention is to map
a file into shared memory.
In this case, the <b>map</b> function must map the first <b>len</b>
bytes of the file into memory and return a pointer to the mapped
location in the memory location referenced by the argument <b>addr</b>.
In this case, the <b>is_anonymous</b> argument will always be zero.
The <b>is_rdonly</b> argument will be non-zero if the file is considered
read-only by the caller.
<p>
The <b>is_region</b> argument will be non-zero if the memory is intended
to be used as a shared memory region for synchronization between Berkeley DB
threads/processes.
In this case, the returned memory may be of any kind (e.g., anonymous),
but must be able to support semaphores.
If the application has previously specified that regions are to be
instantiated in anonymous memory (see DB_REGION_ANON below),
or the region is being joined and is believed to have been allocated
in anonymous shared memory, the <b>is_anonymous</b> argument will be
non-zero.
Additionally, the <b>path</b> and <b>fd</b> arguments may be ignored
(although future <b>map</b> calls using the same <b>path</b> must
return the same memory), and the <b>is_rdonly</b> argument will always
be zero.
<p>
By default, on UNIX systems, the Berkeley DB library will use the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX)
<b>mmap</b>(2) interface to both map regular files into shared memory
and create shared memory regions.
If the application specifies that shared memory regions be instantiated
in anonymous memory (see DB_REGION_ANON below), the
<b>shmget</b>(2) shared memory segment interface will be used, where
available, and the MAP_ANON or MAP_ANONYMOUS options to
<b>mmap</b>(2) when <b>shmget</b>(2) is not available.
<p>
When using <b>shmget 2</b>(), shared memory regions are named, and so
multiple processes may share them.
When using the <b>mmap</b> MAP_ANON or MAP_ANONYMOUS options, shared
memory regions are <b>not</b> named, and so may only be accessed by a
single process and its threads.
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>HP/UX note:<dd>The <b>shmget</b>(2) interfaces are not used on HP/UX, even though
they exist, as anonymous memory allocated using <b>shmget</b>(2)
cannot be used to store semaphores.
<p><dt>SunOS note:<dd>The <b>shmget</b>(2) interfaces are not used on SunOS, even though
they apparently exist, as the distributed include files did not allow them
to be compiled.
<p><dt>Ultrix note:<dd>The <b>mmap</b>(2) interfaces are not used on Ultrix, even though
they exist, as they do not work correctly.
<p><dt>Windows/95 note:<dd>On Windows/95, files that are opened by multiple processes do not share
data correctly.  To cause Berkeley DB to use a named region of the paging
file to share memory instead, use:
<p><ul><pre>db_value_set(1, DB_REGION_NAME);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
You do not need to do this if your application can guarantee that only one
process will be accessing Berkeley DB files.
</dl>
<p>
The <b>map</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_OPEN">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_OPEN<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX) <b>open</b> function
with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_READ">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_READ<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX) <b>read</b> function
with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_REALLOC">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_REALLOC<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the ANSI C X3.159-1989 (ANSI C) standard
<b>realloc</b> function with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard
interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_RUNLINK">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_RUNLINK<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to remove shared memory regions from
the system, whether or not they are backed by regular files.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>int runlink(char *path);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>path</b> argument is the path argument specified to the DB_FUNC_MAP
function when the region was mapped into memory.
<p>
The <b>runlink</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_SEEK">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_SEEK<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to specify that a subsequent read from
or write to a file will occur at a specific location in that file.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>
int seek(int fd, size_t pgsize, db_pgno_t pageno,
    u_int32_t relative, int rewind, int whence);</pre></ul><p>
The <b>fd</b> argument is an open file descriptor on the file.
The <b>seek</b> function must cause a subsequent read from or write to the
file to occur at a byte offset specified by the calculation:
<p><ul><pre>(pgsize * pageno) + relative</pre></ul><p>
<p>
If <b>rewind</b> is non-zero, the byte offset is treated as a backwards
seek, not a forwards one.
<p>
The <b>whence</b> argument specifies where in the file the byte offset is
relative to, as described by the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX) <b>lseek</b> system call.
<p>
The <b>seek</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_SLEEP">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_SLEEP<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to cause a process to suspend itself
for a period of time, relinquishing control of the processor to any other
waiting thread of control.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>int sleep(u_long seconds, u_long microseconds);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>seconds</b> and <b>microseconds</b> arguments specify the amount
of time to wait until the suspending thread of control should run again.
<p>
The <b>seconds</b> and <b>microseconds</b> arguments may not be normalized
when the <b>sleep</b> function is called, i.e., the <b>microseconds</b>
argument may be greater than 1000000.
<p>
The <b>sleep</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_UNLINK">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_UNLINK<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX) <b>unlink</b> function
with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_UNMAP">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_UNMAP<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to unmap a file or shared memory region
from memory.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>int unmap(void *addr, size_t len);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>addr</b> argument is the argument returned by the DB_FUNC_MAP function
when the file or region was mapped into memory, and the <b>len</b> argument
is the same as the <b>len</b> argument specified to the DB_FUNC_MAP function
when the file or region was mapped into memory.
<p>
The <b>unmap</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
<a name="DB_FUNC_WRITE">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_WRITE<dd>
Replace Berkeley DB calls to the IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 (POSIX) <b>write</b> function
with <b>func</b>, which must conform to the standard interface.
<a name="DB_FUNC_YIELD">
<p><dt>DB_FUNC_YIELD<dd>The Berkeley DB library requires the ability to yield the processor from the current
thread of control to any other waiting threads of control.
The <b>func</b> argument must conform to the following interface:
<p><ul><pre>int yield(void);</pre></ul><p>
<p>
The <b>yield</b> function must be able to cause the rescheduling all
participants in the current Berkeley DB environment, whether threaded or not.
It may be incorrect to supply a thread <b>yield</b> function if more
than a single process is operating in the Berkeley DB environment.
This is because many thread-yield functions will not allow other processes
to run, and the contested lock may be held by another process, not by
another thread.
<p>
If no <b>yield</b> function is specified, or if the <b>yield</b>
function returns an error, the function specified by the DB_FUNC_SLEEP
entry will be used instead or subsequently, i.e., if no <b>yield</b>
function is specified, or it is possible for the <b>yield</b> function
to fail, the <b>sleep</b> function <b>must</b> cause the processor
to reschedule any waiting threads of control for execution.
<dl compact>
<p><dt>Solaris note:<dd>Because of bugs in the Solaris C library, the Berkeley DB library uses the
undocumented <b>_lock_try</b> and <b>_lock_clear</b> function
calls instead of either the <b>sema_trywait</b>(3T) or
<b>sema_wait</b>(3T) function calls.
</dl>
<p>
The <b>yield</b> function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure
and 0 on success.
</dl>
<p>
Applications should be careful to replace related functions as a group
and at the same time.
Replacing DB_FUNC_MALLOC without replacing DB_FUNC_REALLOC is likely
to result in unpredictable results.
<p>
The db_jump_set
function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the db_jump_set function may fail and return
DB_RUNRECOVERY, at which point all subsequent database calls will also
return DB_RUNRECOVERY.
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
