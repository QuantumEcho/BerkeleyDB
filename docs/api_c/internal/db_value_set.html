<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The db_value_set function enables applications to specify the
behavior of underlying Berkeley DB library functionality.
The <b>which</b> argument specifies the information being set by the
argument <b>value</b>.
<p>
The following values of <b>which</b> are supported:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_MUTEXLOCKS">
<p><dt>DB_MUTEXLOCKS<dd>Setting <b>value</b> to a zero value causes Berkeley DB to grant all
requested mutual exclusion mutexes without testing for their availability.
This flag should never be used for any other purpose than debugging.
<a name="DB_REGION_ANON">
<p><dt>DB_REGION_ANON<dd>Setting <b>value</b> to a non-zero value specifies that shared memory
regions are to be created in anonymous memory, and not backed by a regular
file.
DB_REGION_NAME differs from DB_REGION_ANON in that the former will fail if
the shared memory regions cannot be named, that is, if multiple processes
cannot use them.
See <a href="../internal/db_jump_set.html#DB_FUNC_MAP">DB_FUNC_MAP</a> for more
information.
<a name="DB_REGION_INIT">
<p><dt>DB_REGION_INIT<dd>In some applications, the expense of page-faulting the shared memory regions
can affect performance, e.g., when the page-fault occurs while holding a lock,
other lock requests can convoy and overall throughput may decrease.
Setting <b>value</b> to a non-zero value specifies that one byte be written
to each 4K page of the shared memory region when the region is initialized.
<p>
In addition, as a byte is written to each page, the underlying virtual
memory and file systems are forced to instantiate both the necessary
memory and the necessary disk space.  This is useful in order to avoid
out-of-disk space failures later on.
<a name="DB_REGION_NAME">
<p><dt>DB_REGION_NAME<dd>Setting <b>value</b> to a non-zero value specifies that shared memory
regions are to be created in anonymous memory, and not backed by a regular
file.
DB_REGION_NAME differs from DB_REGION_ANON in that the former will fail if
the shared memory regions cannot be named, that is, if multiple processes
cannot use them.
See <a href="../internal/db_jump_set.html#DB_FUNC_MAP">DB_FUNC_MAP</a> for more
information.
<a name="DB_TSL_SPINS">
<p><dt>DB_TSL_SPINS<dd>Specify the number of times mutexes should spin without blocking.
<p>
This value defaults to 1 on uniprocessor systems and to 50 times the number
of processors on multiprocessor systems.]
</dl>
<p>
The db_value_set
function returns the value of <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the db_value_set function may fail and return
DB_RUNRECOVERY, at which point all subsequent database calls will also
return DB_RUNRECOVERY.
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
