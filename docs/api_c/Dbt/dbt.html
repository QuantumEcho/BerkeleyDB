<h1>Key/Data Pairs</h1>
<p>
Storage and retrieval for the Berkeley DB access methods are based on key/data pairs.
Both key and data items are represented by the DBT data structure.
(The name DBT is a mnemonic for <i>data base thang</i>, and was used
because noone could think of a reasonable name that wasn't already in
use somewhere else.)
<p>
typedef struct {
<p><ul><pre>void *data;
u_int32_t size;
u_int32_t ulen;
u_int32_t dlen;
u_int32_t doff;
u_int32_t flags;
</pre></ul><p>} DBT;
<p>
Key and data byte strings may reference strings of essentially unlimited
length.  See <a href="../../ref/program/dbsizes.html">Database limits</a>
for more information.
<p>
In order to ensure compatibility with future releases of Berkeley DB,
all fields of the DBT structure that are not explicitly set should be
initialized to 0 before the first time the structure is used.
Do this by declaring the structure external or static,
or by calling the C library routine
<b>bzero</b>(3) or <b>memset</b>(3).
<p>
By default, the <b>flags</b> structure element is expected to be 0.  In
this default case, when being provided a key or data item by the
application, the Berkeley DB package expects the <b>data</b> structure element
to point to a byte string of <b>size</b> bytes.  When returning a
key/data item to the application, the Berkeley DB package will store into the
<b>data</b> structure element a pointer to a byte string of <b>size</b>
bytes.
<p>
The elements of the DBT structure are defined as follows:
<dl compact>
<a name="data">
<p><dt>void *data;<dd>A pointer to a byte string.
<a name="size">
<p><dt>u_int32_t size;<dd>The length of <b>data</b>, in bytes.
<a name="ulen">
<p><dt>u_int32_t ulen;<dd>The size of the user's buffer (referenced by <b>data</b>), in bytes.
This location is not written by the Berkeley DB functions.
<p>
Note that applications can determine the length of a record by setting
the <b>ulen</b> field to 0 and checking the return value in the
<b>size</b> field.  See the DB_DBT_USERMEM flag for more information.
<a name="dlen">
<p><dt>u_int32_t dlen;<dd>The length of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
<a name="doff">
<p><dt>u_int32_t doff;<dd>The offset of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
<p><dt>u_int32_t flags;<dd>The flags value is specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or more of the
following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_DBT_MALLOC">
<p><dt>DB_DBT_MALLOC<dd>Ignored except when retrieving information from a database, e.g., a
<a href="../../api_c/Db/get.html">DB->get</a> or <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html">DBcursor->c_get</a> call.
This flag causes Berkeley DB to allocate memory for the returned key or data
item (using <b>malloc</b>(3), or the user-specified malloc function)
and return a pointer to it in the <b>data</b> field of the key or data
DBT structure.
The allocated memory becomes the responsibility of the calling application.
<p>
It is an error to specify both DB_DBT_MALLOC and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<a name="DB_DBT_USERMEM">
<p><dt>DB_DBT_USERMEM<dd>Ignored except when retrieving information from a database, e.g., a
<a href="../../api_c/Db/get.html">DB->get</a>, or <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html">DBcursor->c_get</a> call.
The <b>data</b> field of the key or data structure must reference memory
that is at least <b>ulen</b> bytes in length.
If the length of the requested item is less than or equal to that number
of bytes,
the item is copied into the memory referenced by the <b>data</b> field.
Otherwise, the <b>size</b> field is set to the length needed for the
requested item, and the error ENOMEM is returned.
It is an error to specify both DB_DBT_MALLOC and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<a name="DB_DBT_PARTIAL">
<p><dt>DB_DBT_PARTIAL<dd>Ignored except when specified for a data parameter,
where this flag causes the partial retrieval or storage of an item.
If the calling application is doing a get, the <b>dlen</b> bytes
starting <b>doff</b> bytes from the beginning of the retrieved data
record are returned as if they comprised the entire record.
If any or all of the specified bytes do not exist in the record,
the get is successful and the existing bytes or 0 bytes are returned.
<p>
For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial retrieval was done using a DBT having a <b>dlen</b>
field of 20 and a <b>doff</b> field of 85, the get call would succeed,
the <b>data</b> field would reference the last 15 bytes of the record,
and the <b>size</b> field would be set to 15.
<p>
If the calling application is doing a put, the <b>dlen</b> bytes
starting <b>doff</b> bytes from the beginning of the specified key's
data record are replaced by the data specified by the <b>data</b>
and <b>size</b> structure elements.
If <b>dlen</b> is smaller than <b>size</b>, the record will grow,
and if <b>dlen</b> is larger than <b>size</b>, the record will shrink.
If the specified bytes do not exist, the record will be extended using
nul bytes as necessary, and the put call will succeed.
<p>
It is an error to attempt a partial put using the <a href="../../api_c/Db/get.html">DB->get</a> function
in a database that supports duplicate records.
Partial puts in databases supporting duplicate records must be done
using a <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/put.html">DBcursor->c_put</a> function.
It is an error to attempt a partial put with differing <b>dlen</b> and
<b>size</b> values in a recno database with fixed-length records.
<p>
For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial put was done using a DBT having a <b>dlen</b> field of 20,
a <b>doff</b> field of 85, and a <b>size</b> field of 30, the resulting
record would be 115 bytes in length, where the last 30 bytes would be
those specified by the put call.

<p>
<b>Retrieved key/data permanence:</b>
When using the non-cursor Berkeley DB calls to retrieve key/data items (e.g.,
<a href="../../api_c/Db/get.html">DB->get</a>), the memory referenced by the pointer stored into the
DBT is only valid until the next call to Berkeley DB using the DB
handle returned by <a href="../../api_c/Db/open.html">db_open</a>.  (This includes <b>any</b> use of
the returned DB handle, including by another thread of control
within the process.  For this reason, when multiple threads are using the
returned DB handle concurrently, either the DB_DBT_MALLOC or
DB_DBT_USERMEM flag must be specified for any non-cursor DBT
used for key or data retrieval.)  When using the cursor Berkeley DB calls to
retrieve key/data items (e.g., <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html">DBcursor->c_get</a>), the memory referenced by
the pointer into the DBT is only valid until the next call to
Berkeley DB using the DBC handle returned by <a href="../../api_c/Db/cursor.html">DB->cursor</a>.
<p>
<b>
The Berkeley DB access methods provide no guarantees about key/data byte string
alignment, and applications are responsible for arranging any necessary
alignment.</b> The DB_DBT_MALLOC and DB_DBT_USERMEM flags may be used to
store returned items in memory of arbitrary alignment.
<h1>Logical Record Numbers</h1>
In all cases for the recno access method, and when calling the
<a href="../../api_c/Db/get.html">DB->get</a> and <a href="../../api_c/Dbc/get.html">DBcursor->c_get</a> functions with the
DB_SET_RECNO flag specified, the <b>data</b> field of the key
must be a pointer to a memory location of type <b>db_recno_t</b>,
as typedef'd in the #include &lt;db.h&gt; include file.
This type is a 32-bit unsigned type, (which limits the number of
logical records in a recno database, and the maximum logical record
which may be directly retrieved from a btree database, to 4,294,967,296).
The <b>size</b> field of the key should be the size of that type, i.e.,
in the C programming language, <b>sizeof(db_recno_t)</b>.
<p>
Logical record numbers are 1-based, not 0-based, i.e., the first record
in the database is record number 1.
