<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
This manual page describes the specific details of the Dbt class,
used to encode keys and data items in a database.
<p>
<h1>Key/Data Pairs</h1>
<p>
Storage and retrieval for the <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/class.html">Db</a> access methods are based on
key/data pairs.
Both key and data items are represented by Dbt objects.
<p>
Key and data byte strings may reference strings of essentially unlimited
length.  See <a href="../../ref/program/dbsizes.html">Database limits</a>
for more information.
<p>
The Dbt class provides simple access to an underlying data structure,
whose elements can be examined or changed using the <b>set_</b> or
<b>get_</b> methods.  The remainder of the manual page sometimes refers
to these accesses using the underlying name, e.g., simply <b>ulen</b>
instead of <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::get_ulen</a> and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::set_ulen</a>.
<p>
The constructors set all elements of the underlying structure to zero.
The constructor with two arguments has the effect of setting all elements
to zero except for the specified <b>data</b> and <b>size</b> elements.
In the case where the <b>flags</b> structure element is 0, when being
provided a key or data item by the application, the Berkeley DB package expects
the <b>data</b> object to point to a byte string of <b>size</b> bytes.
When returning a key/data item to the application, the Berkeley DB package will
store into the <b>data</b> object a pointer to a byte string of
<b>size</b> bytes.
<p>
The elements of the structure underlying the Dbt class are defined as follows:
<dl compact>
<a name="data">
<p><dt>void *data;<dd>
A pointer to a byte string.
This element is accessed using <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::get_data</a> and
<a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::set_data</a>, and may be initialized using one
of the constructors.
<p><dt>int offset;<dd>
The number of bytes offset into the <b>data</b> array to determine the
portion of the array actually used.
This element is accessed using dbt_get_offset and
dbt_set_offset.
<p><dt>u_int32_t size;<dd>
The length of <b>data</b>, in bytes.
This element is accessed using <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::get_size</a> and
<a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::set_size</a>, and may be initialized
using the constructor with two arguments.
<p><dt>u_int32_t ulen;<dd>
The size of the user's buffer (referenced by <b>data</b>), in bytes.
This location is not written by the <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/class.html">Db</a> methods.
<p>
Note that applications can determine the length of a record by setting
the <b>ulen</b> to 0 and checking the return value found in <b>size</b>.
See the DB_DBT_USERMEM flag for more information.
<p>
This element is accessed using
<a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::get_ulen</a> and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::set_ulen</a>.
<p><dt>u_int32_t dlen;<dd>
The length of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
This element is accessed using
<a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::get_dlen</a>, and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::set_dlen</a>.
<p><dt>u_int32_t doff;<dd>
The offset of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
This element is accessed using
<a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::get_doff</a> and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::set_doff</a>.
<p><dt>u_int32_t flags;<dd>
This element is accessed using <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::get_flags</a> and
<a href="../../api_cxx/Dbt/class.html">Dbt::set_flags</a>.
The flags value is specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or more of the
following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_DBT_MALLOC">
<p><dt>DB_DBT_MALLOC<dd>
Ignored except when retrieving information from a database, e.g., a
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/get.html">Db::get</a> or <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html">Dbc::get</a> call.
This flag causes <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/class.html">Db</a> to allocate memory for the returned key or
data item
(using <b>malloc</b>(3) or the user-specified malloc method)
and return a pointer to it in the <b>data</b> field of the key
or data Dbt object.
The allocated memory becomes the responsibility of the calling application.
<p>
It is an error to specify both DB_DBT_MALLOC and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<a name="DB_DBT_USERMEM">
<p><dt>DB_DBT_USERMEM<dd>
Ignored except when retrieving information from a database, e.g., a
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/get.html">Db::get</a> or <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html">Dbc::get</a> call.
The <b>data</b> field of the key or data object must reference memory
that is at least <b>ulen</b> bytes in length.
If the length of the requested item is less than or equal to that number
of bytes, the item is copied into the memory referenced by the <b>data</b>
field.
Otherwise, the <b>size</b> field is set to the length needed for the
requested item, and the error ENOMEM is returned.
<p>
It is an error to specify both DB_DBT_MALLOC and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<a name="DB_DBT_PARTIAL">
<p><dt>DB_DBT_PARTIAL<dd>
Ignored except when specified for a data parameter, where this flag causes
the partial retrieval or storage of an item.
If the calling application is doing a get, the <b>dlen</b> bytes starting
<b>doff</b> bytes from the beginning of the retrieved data record are
returned as if they comprised the entire record.
If any or all of the specified bytes do not exist in the record,
the get is successful and the existing bytes or 0 bytes are returned.
<p>
For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial retrieval was done using a Dbt having a dlen
field of 20 and a doff field of 85, the get call would succeed,
the data field would reference the last 15 bytes of the record,
and the size field would be set to 15.
<p>
If the calling application is doing a put, the dlen bytes starting
doff bytes from the beginning of the specified key's data record
are replaced by the data specified by the data and size
objects.
If dlen is smaller than size, the record will grow, and if
dlen is larger than size, the record will shrink.
If the specified bytes do not exist, the record will be extended using nul
bytes as necessary, and the put call will succeed.
<p>
It is an error to attempt a partial put using the <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/put.html">Db::put</a>
method in a database that supports duplicate records.
Partial puts in databases supporting duplicate records must be done
using a <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/class.html">Dbc</a> method.
It is an error to attempt a partial put with differing dlen and
size values in a recno database with fixed-length records.
<p>
For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial put was done using a Dbt having a dlen
field of 20, a doff field of 85, and a size field of 30,
the resulting record would be 115 bytes in length, where the last 30
bytes would be those specified by the put call.

<p>
<b>Retrieved key/data permanence:</b>
When using the non-cursor Berkeley DB calls to retrieve key/data items (e.g.,
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/get.html">Db::get</a>), the memory referenced by the pointer stored into the
Dbt is only valid until the next call to Berkeley DB using the
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/class.html">Db</a> handle returned by <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/open.html">Db::open</a>.  (This includes
<b>any</b> use of the returned <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/class.html">Db</a> handle, including by another
thread of control within the process.  For this reason, when multiple
threads are using the returned DB handle concurrently, either the
DB_DBT_MALLOC or DB_DBT_USERMEM flag must be specified for any non-cursor
Dbt used for key or data retrieval.) When using the cursor Berkeley DB
calls to retrieve key/data items (e.g., <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html">Dbc::get</a>), the memory
referenced by the pointer into the Dbt is only valid until the
next call to Berkeley DB using the <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/class.html">Dbc</a> handle returned by
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/cursor.html">Db::cursor</a>.
<p>
<b>
The Berkeley DB access methods provide no guarantees about key/data byte string
alignment, and applications are responsible for arranging any necessary
alignment.</b> The DB_DBT_MALLOC and DB_DBT_USERMEM flags may be used to
store returned items in memory of arbitrary alignment.
<h1>Logical Record Numbers</h1>
In all cases for the recno access method, and when calling the
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/get.html">Db::get</a> and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html">Dbc::get</a> functions with the
DB_SET_RECNO flag specified, the <b>data</b>
field of the key must be a pointer to a memory location of type
<b>db_recno_t</b>, as typedef'd in the #include &lt;db_cxx.h&gt; include file.
This type is a 32-bit unsigned type,
(which limits the number of
logical records in a recno database, and the maximum logical record
which may be directly retrieved from a btree database, to 4,294,967,296).
The <b>size</b> field of the key should be the size of that type, i.e.,
in the C programming language, <b>sizeof(db_recno_t)</b>.
<p>
Logical record numbers are 1-based, not 0-based, i.e., the first record
in the database is record number 1.
