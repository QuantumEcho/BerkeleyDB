<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The Db::join method creates a specialized cursor for use in performing
joins on secondary indices.  Your data must be organized in the following
manner in order to take advantage of this:
<ol>
<p><li>The actual data should be stored in the database represented by the
primary <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/class.html">Db</a> handle.
<p><li>Secondary indices should be stored in separate database files, whose keys
are the values of the secondary indices and whose data items are the
primary keys corresponding to the records having the designated secondary
key value.  It is acceptable (and expected) that there may be duplicate
entries in the secondary indices.
<p>
These duplicate entries should be sorted.  For more information see
the <a href="../../api_cxx/DbInfo/set_flags.html#DB_DUPSORT">DB_DUPSORT</a> flag to the <a href="../../api_cxx/DbInfo/set_flags.html">DbInfo::set_flags</a> method.
</ol>
<p>
The <b>primary</b> argument contains the <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/class.html">Db</a> handle of the
primary database, which is keyed by the data values found in entries
in the <b>curslist</b>.
<p>
The <b>curslist</b> argument contains a NULL terminated array of
<a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/class.html">Dbc</a> objects.  Each <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/class.html">Dbc</a> must have been initialized to
reference the key on which the underlying database should be joined.
Typically, this initialization is done by a <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html">Dbc::get</a> call with
the <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html#DB_SET">DB_SET</a> flag specified.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> parameter is currently unused, and must be set to 0.
<p>
The newly created cursor is returned in the memory location referenced
by <b>dbcp</b>.
<p>
The returned cursor has the standard cursor functions, that behave as
follows:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>Dbc::get<dd>Iterates over the values associated with the keys to which each item in
<b>curslist</b> has been initialized.  Any data value which appears in
all items specified by the <b>curslist</b> argument is then used as a
key into the <b>primary</b>, and the key/data pair found in the
<b>primary</b> is returned.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to 0 or the following value:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_JOIN_ITEM">
<p><dt>DB_JOIN_ITEM<dd>Do not use the data value found in all of the cursors as a lookup
key for the <b>primary</b>, but simply return it in the key parameter
instead.  The data parameter is left unchanged.
</dl>
<p>
In addition, the following value may be set by logically <b>OR</b>'ing it into the
<b>flags</b> parameter:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_RMW<dd>Acquire write locks instead of read locks when doing the retrieval.
Setting this flag may decrease the likelihood of deadlock during a
read-modify-write cycle by immediately acquiring the write lock during
the read part of the cycle so that another thread of control acquiring
a read lock for the same item, in its own read-modify-write cycle, will
not result in deadlock.
</dl>
<p><dt>Dbc::put<dd>Returns EINVAL.
<p><dt>Dbc::del<dd>Returns EINVAL.
<p><dt>Dbc::close<dd>Close the cursor and release all resources.  (Closing the
cursors in <b>curslist</b> is the responsibility of the caller.)
</dl>
<p>
In a transaction protected environment, all of the cursors listed in
<b>curslist</b> must have been created within the same transaction.
<p>
The Db::join
method either returns <b>errno</b> or throws an exception that
encapsulates an <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the Db::join method may fail and either
return DB_RUNRECOVERY or throw an exception encapsulating DB_RUNRECOVERY,
at which point all subsequent database calls will also fail in the same
way.  Methods marked as returning <b>errno</b> will, by default, throw
an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The default error
behavior can be changed, see <a href="../../api_cxx/DbException/class.html">DbException</a>.
<p>
The Db::join
method may fail and throw an exception
for any of the errors specified for the following Berkeley DB and C library
functions:
fflush(3),
fprintf(3),
free(3),
malloc(3),
memset(3),
vfprintf(3),
and
vsnprintf(3).
<p>
In addition, the Db::join
method may fail and throw an exception
or return <b>errno</b>
for the following conditions:
<p>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>
The <b>c_put</b> or <b>c_del</b> functions were called.
</dl>
