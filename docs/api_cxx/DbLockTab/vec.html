<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The DbLockTab::vec method atomically obtains and releases one or more locks
from the lock table.  The DbLockTab::vec method is intended to support
acquisition or trading of multiple locks under one lock table semaphore,
as is needed for lock coupling or in multigranularity locking for lock
escalation.
<p>
The <b>locker</b> argument specified to DbLockTab::vec is an unsigned
32-bit integer quantity.  It represents the entity requesting or releasing
the lock.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> value must be set to 0 or the following value:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_LOCK_NOWAIT">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_NOWAIT<dd>If a lock cannot be granted because the requested lock conflicts with an
existing lock, return immediately instead of waiting for the lock to
become available.
</dl>
<p>
The <b>list</b> array provided to DbLockTab::vec is typedef'd as
DB_LOCKREQ.  A DB_LOCKREQ structure has at least the following fields,
which must be initialized before calling DbLockTab::vec:
<dl compact>
<a name="op">
<p><dt>lockop_t op;<dd>The operation to be performed, which must be set to one of the
following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_LOCK_GET">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_GET<dd>Get a lock, as defined by the values of <b>locker</b>, <b>obj</b>, and
<b>mode</b>.
Upon return from DbLockTab::vec, if the <b>lock</b> field is non-NULL,
a reference to the acquired lock is stored there.
(This reference is invalidated by any call to DbLockTab::vec or
<a href="../../api_cxx/DbLock/put.html">DbLock::put</a> that releases the lock.)
<a name="DB_LOCK_PUT">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_PUT<dd>The lock referenced by the contents of the <b>lock</b> field is released.
<a name="DB_LOCK_PUT_ALL">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_PUT_ALL<dd>All locks held by the <b>locker</b> are released.
(Any locks acquired as a part of the current call to DbLockTab::vec that
appear after the DB_LOCK_PUT_ALL entry are not considered for
this operation).
<a name="DB_LOCK_PUT_OBJ">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_PUT_OBJ<dd>All locks held by the <b>locker</b>, on the object <b>obj</b>, with the
mode specified by <b>lock_mode</b>, are released.  A <b>lock_mode</b>
of DB_LOCK_NG indicates that all locks on the object should be
released.  Note that any locks acquired as a part of the current call to
DbLockTab::vec that occur before the DB_LOCK_PUT_OBJ will also
be released; those acquired afterwards will not be released.
</dl>
<a name="obj">
<p><dt>const Dbt obj;<dd>An untyped byte string that specifies the object to be locked or released.
<a name="mode">
<a name="mode">
<p><dt>const lockmode_t mode;<dd>The lock mode, used as an index into <b>lt</b>'s conflict array.
<a name="lock">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK lock;<dd>A lock reference.
</dl>
<p>
The <b>nlist</b> argument specifies the number of elements in the
<b>list</b> array.
<p>
If any of the requested locks cannot be acquired, or any of the locks to be
released cannot be released, the operations before the failing operation are
guaranteed to have completed successfully, and DbLockTab::vec returns a
non-zero value.  In addition, if <b>elistp</b> is not NULL, it is set to
point to the DB_LOCKREQ entry that was being processed when the error occurred.
<p>
In the case of an error, DbLockTab::vec may return one of the following
values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK<dd>The specified <b>locker</b> was selected as a victim in order to resolve
a deadlock.
<a name="DB_LOCK_NOTHELD">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_NOTHELD<dd>The lock cannot be released, as it was not held by the <b>locker</b>.
<a name="DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED">
<p><dt>DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED<dd>A lock was requested that could not be granted and the <b>flag</b>
parameter was set to DB_LOCK_NOWAIT.
In this case, if non-NULL, <b>elistp</b> identifies the request that was
granted.
</dl>
<p>
Otherwise, the DbLockTab::vec
method either returns <b>errno</b> or throws an exception that
encapsulates an <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the DbLockTab::vec method may fail and either
return DB_RUNRECOVERY or throw an exception encapsulating DB_RUNRECOVERY,
at which point all subsequent database calls will also fail in the same
way.  Methods marked as returning <b>errno</b> will, by default, throw
an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The default error
behavior can be changed, see <a href="../../api_cxx/DbException/class.html">DbException</a>.
<p>
The DbLockTab::vec
method may fail and throw an exception
for any of the errors specified for the following Berkeley DB and C library
functions:
abort(3),
fcntl(3),
fflush(3),
fprintf(3),
fsync(3),
getpid(3),
isprint(3),
<a href="../../api_cxx/DbLockTab/detect.html">DbLockTab::detect</a>,
lseek(3),
memcpy(3),
memset(3),
mmap(3),
munmap(3),
printf(3),
pstat_getdynamic(3),
shmat(3),
shmdt(3),
strerror(3),
sysconf(3),
vfprintf(3),
vsnprintf(3),
and
write(3).
<p>
In addition, the DbLockTab::vec
method may fail and throw an exception
or return <b>errno</b>
for the following conditions:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EACCES<dd>An attempt was made to release lock held by another locker.
</dl>
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>
</dl>
