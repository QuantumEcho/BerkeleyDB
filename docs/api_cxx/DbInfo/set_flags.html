<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The following additional flags may be specified for the Btree access method:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_DUP">
<p><dt>DB_DUP<dd>Permit duplicate data items in the tree, i.e. insertion when the key of
the key/data pair being inserted already exists in the tree will be
successful.  The ordering of duplicates in the tree is determined by the
order of insertion, unless the ordering is otherwise specified by use of
a cursor or a duplicate comparison function.
It is an error to specify both DB_DUP and DB_RECNUM.
<a name="DB_DUPSORT">
<p><dt>DB_DUPSORT<dd>Sort duplicates within a set of data items.  If the application does not
specify a comparison function using the <a href="../../api_cxx/DbInfo/set_compare.html">DbInfo::set_compare</a> method,
a default, lexical comparison will be used.
<p>
Specifying that duplicates are to be sorted changes the behavior of the
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/put.html">Db::put</a> operation as well as the <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/put.html">Dbc::put</a> operation when
the <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYFIRST">DB_KEYFIRST</a>, <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYLAST">DB_KEYLAST</a> and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html#DB_CURRENT">DB_CURRENT</a>
flags are specified.
<a name="DB_RECNUM">
<p><dt>DB_RECNUM<dd>
Support retrieval from btrees using record numbers.
For more information, see the DB_GET_RECNO flag to the <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/get.html">Db::get</a>
and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html">Dbc::get</a> methods.
<p>
Logical record numbers in btrees are mutable in the face of record
insertion or deletion.
See the DB_RENUMBER flag in the Recno access method information for
further discussion.
<p>
Maintaining record counts within a btree introduces a serious point of
contention, namely the page locations where the record counts are stored.
In addition, the entire tree must be locked during both insertions and
deletions, effectively single-threading the tree for those operations.
Specifying DB_RECNUM can result in serious performance degradation for
some applications and data sets.
<p>
It is an error to specify both DB_DUP and DB_RECNUM.
</dl>
<p>
The following additional flags may be specified for the Hash access method:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_DUP">
<p><dt>DB_DUP<dd>Permit duplicate data items in the tree, i.e. insertion when the key of
the key/data pair being inserted already exists in the tree will be
successful.  The ordering of duplicates in the tree is determined by the
order of insertion, unless the ordering is otherwise specified by use of
a cursor or a duplicate comparison function.
<a name="DB_DUPSORT">
<p><dt>DB_DUPSORT<dd>Sort duplicates within a set of data items.  If the application does not
specify a comparison function using the <a href="../../api_cxx/DbInfo/set_compare.html">DbInfo::set_compare</a> method,
a default, lexical comparison will be used.
<p>
Specifying that duplicates are to be sorted changes the behavior of the
<a href="../../api_cxx/Db/put.html">Db::put</a> operation as well as the <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/put.html">Dbc::put</a> operation when
the <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYFIRST">DB_KEYFIRST</a>, <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/put.html#DB_KEYLAST">DB_KEYLAST</a> and <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/get.html#DB_CURRENT">DB_CURRENT</a>
flags are specified.
</dl>
<p>
The following additional flags may be specified for the Recno access method:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_DELIMITER<dd>
The <b>re_delim</b> value has been set.
<p><dt>DB_FIXEDLEN<dd>
The records are fixed-length, not byte delimited.
The <b>re_len</b> value specifies the length of the record,
and the <b>re_pad</b> value is used as the pad character.
<p>
Any records added to the database that are less than <b>re_len</b>
bytes long are automatically padded.
Any attempt to insert records into the database that are greater than
<b>re_len</b> bytes long will cause the call to fail immediately and
return an error.
<p><dt>DB_PAD<dd>
The <b>re_pad</b> field has been set.
<p><dt>DB_RENUMBER<dd>
Specifying the DB_RENUMBER flag causes the logical record numbers to be
mutable, and change as records are added to and deleted from the database.
For example, the deletion of record number 4 causes records numbered 5
and greater to be renumbered downward by 1.
If a cursor was positioned to record number 4 before the deletion,
it will reference the new record number 4, if any such record exists,
after the deletion.
If a cursor was positioned after record number 4 before the deletion,
it will be shifted downward 1 logical record,
continuing to reference the same record as it did before.
<p>
Using the <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/put.html">Db::put</a> or <a href="../../api_cxx/Dbc/put.html">Dbc::put</a> interfaces to create
new records will cause the creation of multiple records if the record
number is more than one greater than the largest record currently in the
database.
For example, creating record 28, when record 25 was previously the last
record in the database, will create records 26 and 27 as well as 28.
Attempts to retrieve records that were created in this manner will result
in an error return of DB_KEYEMPTY.
<p>
If a created record is not at the end of the database, all records following
the new record will be automatically renumbered upward by 1.
For example, the creation of a new record numbered 8 causes records
numbered 8 and greater to be renumbered upward by 1.
If a cursor was positioned to record number 8 or greater before the insertion,
it will be shifted upward 1 logical record,
continuing to reference the same record as it did before.
<p>
For these reasons,
concurrent access to a recno database with the DB_RENUMBER flag specified
may be largely meaningless, although it is supported.
<p><dt>DB_SNAPSHOT<dd>
This flag specifies that any specified <b>re_source</b> file be read in its
entirety when <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/open.html">Db::open</a> is called.
If this flag is not specified, the <b>re_source</b> file may be read lazily.
