<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The DbLog::archive method
creates a NULL-terminated array of log or database file names and copies
a pointer to them into the user-specified memory location <b>list</b>.
<p>
By default, DbLog::archive returns the names of all of the log files
that are no longer in use (e.g., no longer involved in active transactions),
and that may safely be archived for catastrophic recovery and then removed
from the system.
If there were no file names to return, <b>list</b> will be set to NULL.
<p>
Arrays of log file names are created in allocated memory.
If
<b>db_malloc</b> is non-NULL, it is called to allocate the memory,
otherwise, the library function <b>malloc</b>(3)) is used.
The function <b>db_malloc</b> must match the calling conventions of
the <b>malloc</b>(3)) library routine.
Regardless, the caller is responsible for deallocating the returned
memory.
To deallocate the returned memory, free each returned memory pointer;
pointers inside the memory do not need to be individually freed.
<p>
The <b>flags</b> argument is specified by logically <b>OR</b>'ing together one or more of
the following values:
<dl compact>
<a name="DB_ARCH_ABS">
<p><dt>DB_ARCH_ABS<dd>All pathnames are returned as absolute pathnames,
instead of relative to the database home directory.
<a name="DB_ARCH_DATA">
<p><dt>DB_ARCH_DATA<dd>Return the database files that need to be archived in order to recover
the database from catastrophic failure.  If any of the database files
have not been accessed during the lifetime of the current log files,
DbLog::archive will not include them in this list.  It is also
possible that some of the files referenced in the log have since been
deleted from the system.
<a name="DB_ARCH_LOG">
<p><dt>DB_ARCH_LOG<dd>Return all the log file names regardless of whether or not they are in
use.
</dl>
<p>
The DB_ARCH_DATA and DB_ARCH_LOG flags are mutually
exclusive.
<p>
See the <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> manual page for more information on database
archival procedures.
<p>
The DbLog::archive method is the underlying method used by the <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> utility.
See the <a href="../../utility/db_archive.html">db_archive</a> utility source code for an example of using DbLog::archive
in a POSIX 1003.1 environment.
<p>
The DbLog::archive
method either returns <b>errno</b> or throws an exception that
encapsulates an <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
<h1>Bugs</h1>
In a threaded application (i.e., one where the environment was created
with the DB_THREAD flag specified), calling DbLog::archive will fail,
returning EINVAL.  To work around this problem, re-open the log explicitly
without specifying DB_THREAD.  This restriction is expected to be removed
in a future version of Berkeley DB.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the DbLog::archive method may fail and either
return DB_RUNRECOVERY or throw an exception encapsulating DB_RUNRECOVERY,
at which point all subsequent database calls will also fail in the same
way.  Methods marked as returning <b>errno</b> will, by default, throw
an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The default error
behavior can be changed, see <a href="../../api_cxx/DbException/class.html">DbException</a>.
<p>
The DbLog::archive
method may fail and throw an exception
for any of the errors specified for the following Berkeley DB and C library
functions:
close(3),
fcntl(3),
fflush(3),
fprintf(3),
free(3),
getcwd(3),
getenv(3),
getpid(3),
getuid(3),
isdigit(3),
<a href="../../api_cxx/DbLog/compare.html">DbLog::compare</a>,
<a href="../../api_cxx/DbLog/get.html">DbLog::get</a>,
malloc(3),
memcpy(3),
memset(3),
open(3),
qsort(3),
realloc(3),
sigfillset(3),
sigprocmask(3),
snprintf(3),
stat(3),
strchr(3),
strcmp(3),
strerror(3),
strlen(3),
unlink(3),
vfprintf(3),
and
vsnprintf(3).
<p>
In addition, the DbLog::archive
method may fail and throw an exception
or return <b>errno</b>
for the following conditions:
<dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>
The log was corrupted.
</dl>
