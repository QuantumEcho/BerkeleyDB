<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The DbMpool::db_register method registers page-in and page-out
functions for files of type <b>ftype</b> in the specified pool.
<p>
If the <b>pgin</b> function is non-NULL, it is called each time a page
is read into the memory pool from a file of type <b>ftype</b>, or a page
is created for a file of type <b>ftype</b> (see the DB_MPOOL_CREATE flag
for the <a href="../../api_cxx/DbMpoolFile/get.html">DbMpoolFile::get</a> method).
<p>
If the <b>pgout</b> function is non-NULL, it is called each time a page
is written to a file of type <b>ftype</b>.
<p>
Both the <b>pgin</b> and <b>pgout</b> functions are called with the page
number, a pointer to the page being read or written, and any argument
<b>pgcookie</b> that was specified to the <a href="../../api_cxx/DbMpoolFile/open.html">DbMpoolFile::open</a> function
when the file was opened.  The <b>pgin</b> and <b>pgout</b> functions
should return 0 on success, and an applicable non-zero <b>errno</b>
value on failure, in which case the shared memory pool interface routine
(and, by extension, any Berkeley DB library function) calling it will also fail,
returning that <b>errno</b> value.
<p>
The purpose of the DbMpool::db_register function is to support
processing when pages are entered into, or flushed from, the pool.
A file type must be specified to make it possible for unrelated threads
or processes, that are sharing a pool, to evict each other's pages from
the pool.  Applications should call DbMpool::db_register, during
initialization, for each type of file requiring input or output processing
that will be sharing the underlying pool.  (No registry is necessary for
the standard access method types, btree, hash and recno, as <a href="../../api_cxx/Db/open.html">Db::open</a>
registers them separately.)
<p>
If a thread or process does not call DbMpool::db_register for a
file type, it is impossible for it to evict pages for any file requiring
input or output processing from the pool.  For this reason,
DbMpool::db_register should always be called by each application
sharing a pool for each type of file included in the pool, regardless of
whether or not the application itself uses files of that type.
<p>
There are no standard values for <b>ftype</b>, <b>pgin</b>, <b>pgout</b>
and <b>pgcookie</b>, except that the <b>ftype</b> value for a file must
be a non-zero positive number, as negative numbers are reserved for internal
use by the Berkeley DB library.  For this reason, applications sharing a pool must
coordinate their values amongst themselves.
<p>
The DbMpool::db_register
method either returns <b>errno</b> or throws an exception that
encapsulates an <b>errno</b> on failure, and 0 on success.
<p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
If a fatal error occurs in Berkeley DB, the DbMpool::db_register method may fail and either
return DB_RUNRECOVERY or throw an exception encapsulating DB_RUNRECOVERY,
at which point all subsequent database calls will also fail in the same
way.  Methods marked as returning <b>errno</b> will, by default, throw
an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The default error
behavior can be changed, see <a href="../../api_cxx/DbException/class.html">DbException</a>.
<p>
The DbMpool::db_register
method may fail and throw an exception
for any of the errors specified for the following Berkeley DB and C library
functions:
abort(3),
fcntl(3),
fprintf(3),
getpid(3),
malloc(3),
and
memset(3).
