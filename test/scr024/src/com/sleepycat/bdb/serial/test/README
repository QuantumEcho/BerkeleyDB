The StoredClassCatalogTest uses database files in the testdata directory to
verify that old versions of a class can be deserialized using information in
the class catalog.

If the package name of the TestSerial class changes, or something else changes
that would cause the serialVersionUID to change, follow these steps to
recreate the database files:

1. Rename TestSerial.java to 'x' or anything out of the way.
2. Copy TestSerial.java.original to TestSerial.java.
3. Comment out the serialVersionUID declaration in TestSerial.java.
4. Delete the two catalogtest-* databases in the source testdata directory.
5. Make and run the test.
6. When the tests run they should print this warning:
 *** WARNING: First time initialization can only be performed using a special
 TestSerial class ***
   If they don't, the existing database files are being used somehow, probably
   because they are being found in the test jar file, which should have been
   rebuilt without them.
7. Copy the two catalog files generated by the test from the test output dir:
      db-test/StoredClassCatalogTest-bdb/catalogtest-*
   to the source testdata directory.
8. Generate the serialVersionUID using:
     serialver -classpath ... com.sleepycat.bdb.serial.test.TestSerial
   and copy the result into both copies of the TestSerial.java file.
9. Rename TestSerial.java to TestSerial.java.original and x to TestSerial.java.
10. Make and run the tests again.  They should pass with no warning message.
