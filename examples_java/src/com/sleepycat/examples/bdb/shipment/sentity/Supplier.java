/**
 * A Supplier represents the combined key/value pair for a supplier entity.
 *
 * <p> In this sample, Supplier is created from the stored key/value data using
 * TupleSerialEntityBinding.  See {@link SampleViews.PartBinding} for details.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> The binding is "tricky" in that it uses this class for both the stored
 * data value and the combined entity object.  To do this, the key field(s) are
 * transient and are set by the binding after the data object has been
 * deserialized. This avoids the use of a SupplierValue class completely. </p>
 *
 * <p> Since this class is used directly for data storage, it must be
 * Serializable. </p>
